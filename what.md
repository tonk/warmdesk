  - Card references (e.g. PRJ-42) in commit messages and PR/issue titles auto-link to cards
  - Linked events appear in a Git Links section on the card detail
- Documentation: user guide, API reference, and admin guide shipped with every release in docs/
- Reports restricted to project admins/owners and system admins; hidden from regular members and viewers

- Close / reopen cards: Close Card button in card detail; closed cards shown with strikethrough and muted opacity on board; closed cards appear in time reports with a "Closed" badge
- Fix due date on board cards showing wrong date in negative-UTC timezones (UTC vs local date slice)
- Due date field replaced from browser date picker to text input following user's configured date format, with clear button
- Spellcheck in card description, comments, and title (plain textarea replaces CodeMirror for editing; markdown preview unchanged)

- Fix project switching in sidebar not reloading board content (watch route slug; useWebSocket accepts reactive ref)
- Due date calendar picker: hidden native `<input type="date">` triggered by a calendar icon button (📅) in the card detail; preserves configured date format display while allowing picker-based input
- Fix default labels not automatically added to new projects created via Admin → Projects (AdminCreateProject was missing the getDefaultLabelDefs() seeding loop)
- Fix custom default columns not applied to new projects: replaced unreliable @change on textarea (destroyed by v-if before event fired) with an explicit Save button in the Project Defaults settings section

- Open card count shown in Admin → Projects table and on dashboard project tiles
- Copy card: duplicate a card within the same column via "Copy Card" button in the card detail footer; title gets "(copy)" suffix; labels and tags are copied; board broadcasts in real time
- Transfer card: copy or move a card to any project via a "Transfer…" panel in card detail; choose destination project and column, then "Copy Here" or "Move Here"; labels/assignees are not copied (project-specific); board updates immediately for all connected users
- Fix report date/time not following configured format (was using toLocaleString; now uses useDateFormat composable)
- Fix report URL printed at bottom of page (suppressed via @page margin rules)
- Fix PDF export missing pages (overflow: hidden on shell body clipped print output; overridden in @media print)
- Fix print header duplicated/cut off across pages (position: fixed replaced with @page margin boxes); WarmDesk logo on page 1; "WarmDesk" + page number (n / total) in top margin on pages 2+
- Fix code blocks unreadable in dark mode: inline code background changed from hard-coded #f1f5f9 to var(--color-border) with explicit text colour; fenced code blocks (pre) styled with var(--color-bg)/var(--color-text) and a border; pre code resets background to transparent
- Fix desktop app cannot connect to server: add tauri-plugin-http so globalThis.fetch uses a native HTTP client that bypasses CORS (Windows Tauri origin https://tauri.localhost was blocked by server CORS policy)
- Fix blank screen on Linux desktop app: set WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 before Tauri starts to work around silent WebKitGTK DMA-BUF renderer failure on many GPU configurations
- CI: upgrade Node.js to 24 in GitHub Actions release workflow
- Add coworker-export: standalone binary to export a Coworker project to Jira, Trello, OpenProject, or Ryver (columns, cards, checklists, comments, labels, tags, time, attachments, topics)
- Add coworker-import: standalone binary to import a project from Jira, Trello, OpenProject, or Ryver into Coworker
- Config file (coworker-migrate.yaml) with column mapping, credential env var overrides, and interactive prompts for missing fields
- Both binaries included in the server distribution build
- Rename product from Coworker to WarmDesk: all binaries, config files, documentation, logos, and the application UI renamed; Go module path updated to github.com/tonk/warmdesk
- Rename migration tool config: YAML section key `coworker:` → `warmdesk:`, env vars `COWORKER_*` → `WARMDESK_*`, default config filename `coworker-migrate.yaml` → `warmdesk-migrate.yaml`, Go type `CoworkerConfig` → `WarmDeskConfig`
- Show full WarmDesk logo (logo-full.svg) in the app header instead of the icon-only mark
- Fix logo-full.svg (and any other non-listed static asset) returning index.html in production: register it explicitly as a static route in the backend router
- Update docs: add Migration Tools section to admin guide, fix header and editor descriptions in user guide, correct API key format example, list all dist binaries in INSTALL.md
- Exclude .claude/ directory from version control via .gitignore
- Resizable sidebar: drag the inner edge to set a custom width (150–480px), persisted in localStorage; handle moves to the correct edge when the sidebar is on the right
- App-wide zoom via Ctrl+/Ctrl-/Ctrl+0 (50%–200%, 10% steps), persisted in localStorage and restored on next load
- Fix Windows desktop app connection: install @tauri-apps/plugin-http JS package so window.fetch is patched at startup and all requests go through the native Rust HTTP client instead of WebView2 (which blocked them as mixed content)
- Fix desktop app Axios requests bypassing tauri-plugin-http: switch to fetch adapter in Tauri so Axios calls are also intercepted by the native client
- Fix GitHub Actions Go cache: point setup-go cache-dependency-path to backend/go.sum
- Opt GitHub Actions into Node.js 24 via FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24
- Fix Linux desktop app blank screen regression (v0.4.3 applied tauri-plugin-http fetch patch on all platforms; now Windows-only)
- Fix Windows desktop app connection: await plugin-http import before Vue mounts so Axios sees the patched fetch from the first request
- Fix Windows desktop app login 403: add `http://tauri.localhost` to CORS allow-list (actual Windows Tauri origin); disable HTTP/2 in tauri-plugin-http; send browser User-Agent to avoid WAF blocks; parse plain-string error response bodies
- Fix `allowed_origins: *` wildcard not working (was treated as literal string)
- Allow server URL to be changed from the login page in the desktop app ("Change" link next to current server)
- Show version number on the Connect screen in the desktop app
- Install window.fetch proxy via inline script in index.html so Tauri HTTP patch is active before any ES module fires a request
- CI: split manual desktop build into per-platform workflows; add manual server build; replace PowerShell version stamping with Node.js
- Database TLS for PostgreSQL and MySQL: db_tls_mode (disable/require/verify-ca/verify-full), db_tls_ca_cert, db_tls_cert, db_tls_key with DB_TLS_* env var overrides; mTLS (client certificate) supported
- Server TLS: set tls_cert and tls_key (or TLS_CERT/TLS_KEY env vars) to serve HTTPS directly without a reverse proxy
- Regenerate all desktop app icons from WarmDesk SVG (removed old Coworker branding from 32x32, 128x128, 128x128@2x, icon.png, icon.ico, icon.icns)
- Desktop app CLI flags: --version/-V prints version and exits; --maximized starts window maximised
- Fix Linux desktop app network error with webkit2gtk 4.1: route all HTTP/HTTPS fetch calls through tauri-plugin-http on all Tauri platforms; non-HTTP requests fall back to native fetch (also fixes blank screen from routing all requests through the plugin)
- Stamp Cargo.toml version from git tag alongside tauri.conf.json; make appimage/dmg/windows-installer targets stamp both files automatically
- Document AppImage build prerequisites (system libraries for Fedora and Ubuntu; Rust install) in INSTALL.md
- Fix Windows release CI: run version-stamping Node.js script under bash instead of PowerShell (PowerShell parsed the regex character class `[^"]*` as an array index and aborted)
- Project-scoped API keys: keys created in Project Settings → API Keys are locked to that project and rejected on any other; personal API keys in User Settings give full access across all projects
- Accept API keys on all authenticated endpoints, not just the Ticket API (X-API-Key header or ?api_key= query param)
- Add base_url config setting (BASE_URL env var) to set the correct host in Swagger UI so "Try it out" calls reach the right server
- Fix font family setting having no effect: load selected fonts (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Source Code Pro) from Google Fonts on demand
- Fix Open Sans and Source Code Pro showing wrong font: extract font name from CSS font-family stack before Google Fonts lookup
- Fix font size setting having no effect: change hardcoded font-size: 14px on button/input/textarea/select to inherit
- Code signing policy section added to README.md as required by SignPath Foundation OSS programme
- Bundle Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Source Code Pro via @fontsource (no Google Fonts CDN); FreeSans, FreeSerif, FreeMono served from /fonts/ (woff files copied from FreeFont project)
- Fix Linux desktop app COLRv1 crash in webkit2gtk/Skia: set HardwareAccelerationPolicy::Never via with_webview API; also set WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 to prevent blank window on many GPU configurations
- Add Linux .desktop file (deploy/warmdesk.desktop) for system-wide installation; document installation steps in INSTALL.md
- Add Ctrl+Scroll mouse wheel zoom (alongside existing Ctrl+/Ctrl-/Ctrl+0 keyboard shortcuts)
- Temporarily disable Windows code signing in release CI (SignPath signing steps commented out)
- Show server version in footer alongside client version (fetched from new public GET /api/v1/version endpoint)
- Fix make appimage/dmg broken by non-semver git tags: pass --match 'v*' to git describe in Makefile

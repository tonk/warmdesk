  - Push / PR / issue events post formatted messages to project chat
  - Card references (e.g. PRJ-42) in commit messages and PR/issue titles auto-link to cards
  - Linked events appear in a Git Links section on the card detail
- Documentation: user guide, API reference, and admin guide shipped with every release in docs/
- Reports restricted to project admins/owners and system admins; hidden from regular members and viewers

- Fix admin settings errors silently swallowed (now shown as toast)
- Fix SMTP password placeholder always shown due to truthy string "false"
- Fix Reports menu hidden for admins with stale cached user object
- Close / reopen cards: Close Card button in card detail; closed cards shown with strikethrough and muted opacity on board; closed cards appear in time reports with a "Closed" badge
- Fix due date on board cards showing wrong date in negative-UTC timezones (UTC vs local date slice)
- Due date field: replace native browser date picker with a plain text input that follows the user's configured date format, plus a clear button
- Spellcheck in card description, comments, and title (plain textarea replaces CodeMirror for editing; markdown preview unchanged)
- Auth tokens moved to sessionStorage so closing the browser ends the session
- Fix project switching in sidebar not reloading board content (watch route slug; useWebSocket accepts reactive ref)
- Due date calendar picker: add a calendar icon button (📅) alongside the text input (previous item) that triggers a hidden native `<input type="date">`; preserves the configured-format text display while also allowing picker-based input
- Fix default labels not automatically added to new projects created via Admin → Projects (AdminCreateProject was missing the getDefaultLabelDefs() seeding loop)
- Fix custom default columns not applied to new projects: replaced unreliable @change on textarea (destroyed by v-if before event fired) with an explicit Save button in the Project Defaults settings section
- Fix saveSetting not updating existing rows: replaced GORM clause.OnConflict upsert (silently failed to UPDATE for string PKs in SQLite) with explicit UPDATE + RowsAffected == 0 → CREATE pattern
- Demo seed tool now configures default system settings: 4 columns (Backlog, In Progress, Test & Review, To Production) and 4 labels (Bug, Feature, Design, Content)
- Fix board cards showing light background in dark mode (hard-coded #fff replaced with var(--color-surface)); priority badge colours now have explicit dark-mode overrides
- Open card count shown in Admin → Projects table and on dashboard project tiles
- Copy card: duplicate a card within the same column via "Copy Card" button in the card detail footer; title gets "(copy)" suffix; labels and tags are copied; board broadcasts in real time
- Transfer card: copy or move a card to any project via a "Transfer…" panel in card detail; choose destination project and column, then "Copy Here" or "Move Here"; labels/assignees are not copied (project-specific); board updates immediately for all connected users
- Fix report date/time not following configured format (was using toLocaleString; now uses useDateFormat composable)
- Fix report URL printed at bottom of page (suppressed via @page margin rules)
- Fix PDF export missing pages (overflow: hidden on shell body clipped print output; overridden in @media print)
- Fix print header duplicated/cut off across pages (position: fixed replaced with @page margin boxes); WarmDesk logo on page 1; "WarmDesk" + page number (n / total) in top margin on pages 2+
- Fix code blocks unreadable in dark mode: inline code background changed from hard-coded #f1f5f9 to var(--color-border) with explicit text colour; fenced code blocks (pre) styled with var(--color-bg)/var(--color-text) and a border; pre code resets background to transparent
- Fix desktop app cannot connect to server: add tauri-plugin-http so globalThis.fetch uses a native HTTP client that bypasses CORS (Windows Tauri origin https://tauri.localhost was blocked by server CORS policy)
- Fix blank screen on Linux desktop app: set WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 before Tauri starts to work around silent WebKitGTK DMA-BUF renderer failure on many GPU configurations

- Add coworker-export: standalone binary to export a Coworker project to Jira, Trello, OpenProject, or Ryver (columns, cards, checklists, comments, labels, tags, time, attachments, topics)
- Add coworker-import: standalone binary to import a project from Jira, Trello, OpenProject, or Ryver into Coworker
- Config file (coworker-migrate.yaml) with column mapping, credential env var overrides, and interactive prompts for missing fields
- Both binaries included in the server distribution build
- Rename product from Coworker to WarmDesk: all binaries, config files, documentation, logos, and the application UI renamed; Go module path updated to github.com/tonk/warmdesk
- Rename migration tool config: YAML section key `coworker:` → `warmdesk:`, env vars `COWORKER_*` → `WARMDESK_*`, default config filename `coworker-migrate.yaml` → `warmdesk-migrate.yaml`, Go type `CoworkerConfig` → `WarmDeskConfig`
- Show full WarmDesk logo (logo-full.svg) in the app header instead of the icon-only mark
- Fix logo-full.svg (and any other non-listed static asset) returning index.html in production: register it explicitly as a static route in the backend router
- Update docs: add Migration Tools section to admin guide, fix header and editor descriptions in user guide, correct API key format example, list all dist binaries in INSTALL.md
- Exclude .claude/ directory from version control via .gitignore
- Resizable sidebar: drag the inner edge to set a custom width (150–480px), persisted in localStorage; handle moves to the correct edge when the sidebar is on the right
- App-wide zoom via Ctrl+/Ctrl-/Ctrl+0 (50%–200%, 10% steps), persisted in localStorage and restored on next load
- Fix Windows desktop app connection: install @tauri-apps/plugin-http JS package so window.fetch is patched at startup and all requests go through the native Rust HTTP client instead of WebView2 (which blocked them as mixed content)
- Fix desktop app Axios requests bypassing tauri-plugin-http: switch to fetch adapter in Tauri so Axios calls are also intercepted by the native client
- Fix GitHub Actions Go cache: point setup-go cache-dependency-path to backend/go.sum
- Opt GitHub Actions into Node.js 24 via FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24
- Fix Linux desktop app blank screen regression (v0.4.3 applied tauri-plugin-http fetch patch on all platforms; now Windows-only)
- Fix Windows desktop app connection: await plugin-http import before Vue mounts so Axios sees the patched fetch from the first request
- Fix Windows desktop app login 403: add `http://tauri.localhost` to CORS allow-list (actual Windows Tauri origin); disable HTTP/2 in tauri-plugin-http; send browser User-Agent to avoid WAF blocks; parse plain-string error response bodies
- Fix `allowed_origins: *` wildcard not working (was treated as literal string)
- Allow server URL to be changed from the login page in the desktop app ("Change" link next to current server)
- Show version number on the Connect screen in the desktop app
- Install window.fetch proxy via inline script in index.html so Tauri HTTP patch is active before any ES module fires a request
- CI: split manual desktop build into per-platform workflows; add manual server build; replace PowerShell version stamping with Node.js
- Database TLS for PostgreSQL and MySQL: db_tls_mode (disable/require/verify-ca/verify-full), db_tls_ca_cert, db_tls_cert, db_tls_key with DB_TLS_* env var overrides; mTLS (client certificate) supported
- Server TLS: set tls_cert and tls_key (or TLS_CERT/TLS_KEY env vars) to serve HTTPS directly without a reverse proxy
- Regenerate all desktop app icons from WarmDesk SVG (removed old Coworker branding from 32x32, 128x128, 128x128@2x, icon.png, icon.ico, icon.icns)
- Desktop app CLI flags: --version/-V prints version and exits; --maximized starts window maximised
- Fix Linux desktop app network error with webkit2gtk 4.1: route all HTTP/HTTPS fetch calls through tauri-plugin-http on all Tauri platforms; non-HTTP requests fall back to native fetch (also fixes blank screen from routing all requests through the plugin)
- Stamp Cargo.toml version from git tag alongside tauri.conf.json; make appimage/dmg/windows-installer targets stamp both files automatically
- Document AppImage build prerequisites (system libraries for Fedora and Ubuntu; Rust install) in INSTALL.md
- Fix Windows release CI: run version-stamping Node.js script under bash instead of PowerShell (PowerShell parsed the regex character class `[^"]*` as an array index and aborted)
- Project-scoped API keys: keys created in Project Settings → API Keys are locked to that project and rejected on any other; personal API keys in User Settings give full access across all projects
- Accept API keys on all authenticated endpoints, not just the Ticket API (X-API-Key header or ?api_key= query param)
- Add base_url config setting (BASE_URL env var) to set the correct host in Swagger UI so "Try it out" calls reach the right server
- Fix font family setting having no effect: load selected fonts (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Source Code Pro) from Google Fonts on demand
- Fix Open Sans and Source Code Pro showing wrong font: extract font name from CSS font-family stack before Google Fonts lookup
- Fix font size setting having no effect: change hardcoded font-size: 14px on button/input/textarea/select to inherit
- Code signing policy section added to README.md as required by SignPath Foundation OSS programme
- Bundle Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Source Code Pro via @fontsource (no Google Fonts CDN); FreeSans, FreeSerif, FreeMono served from /fonts/ (woff files copied from FreeFont project)
- Fix Linux desktop app COLRv1 crash in webkit2gtk/Skia: set HardwareAccelerationPolicy::Never via with_webview API; also set WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 to prevent blank window on many GPU configurations
- Add Linux .desktop file (deploy/warmdesk.desktop) for system-wide installation; document installation steps in INSTALL.md
- Add Ctrl+Scroll mouse wheel zoom (alongside existing Ctrl+/Ctrl-/Ctrl+0 keyboard shortcuts)
- Temporarily disable Windows code signing in release CI (SignPath signing steps commented out)
- Show server version in footer alongside client version (fetched from new public GET /api/v1/version endpoint)
- Fix make appimage/dmg broken by non-semver git tags: pass --match 'v*' to git describe in Makefile
- Fix webhook setup URL showing tauri://localhost in desktop app: use configured server URL instead of window.location.origin for GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea payload URL display
- Fix Forgejo webhook showing Gitea logo on card Git Links: detect platform from X-Forgejo-Event header instead of webhook name
- Fix git links and release notes banner doing nothing when clicked in desktop app: open in system browser via tauri-plugin-opener
- Fix Escape key closing card modal even when a mention dropdown is open: check e.defaultPrevented before closing (second pass)
- Fix Cancel button discarding unsaved card changes silently: show Save / Discard / Back confirmation panel when the card is dirty; Escape also shows this panel when dirty, and closes immediately when the card is clean
- Typing indicator in project chat: animated three-dot indicator shows who is typing; auto-clears after 4 seconds of inactivity
- @mention autocomplete in card description and comment fields (same dropdown as in project chat)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint GET /api/v1/metrics: project count, column count per project, open/closed card count per column; protected by a new metrics global role
- Admin UI: metrics role option added to the role selector in user list and create user form
- Project ordering: admins can drag project tiles on the dashboard to reorder them; order persisted to database and shown to all users
- Fix Linux desktop app blank screen on Fedora / Wayland: at startup, automatically detect libwayland-client.so at well-known paths (Fedora /usr/lib64, Ubuntu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, ARM64, etc.) and re-exec the binary once with LD_PRELOAD set; a sentinel env var (WARMDESK_PRELOAD_DONE) prevents infinite loops; no manual LD_PRELOAD configuration required
- Add Customer/Contract/Project hierarchy: customers are top-level entities; contracts sit under customers; projects can be linked to a customer and optionally to a contract within that customer; manage from a dedicated Customers view and from Project Settings
- Add Customers page (/customers): grid of customer tiles showing name, description, logo, contract count, project count; star/unstar favourites; admins and project owners can create/edit customers and contracts
- Add Customer detail page (/customers/:id): shows customer info, contracts with their projects grouped beneath, and unassigned projects; admins can create/edit/delete contracts; inline name editing for managers
- Add Customers section to sidebar: starred customers shown with star/unstar toggle; link to all customers
- Link projects to customers and contracts via Project Settings General tab; customer and contract dropdowns are filtered and linked
- Show customer name on dashboard project tiles when a project is linked to a customer
- Add sub-cards: cards can have child cards (one level deep) visible only in the parent card's detail view; parent cards show a progress pill (done/total) on the board; sub-cards are hidden from the board column; sub-cards have full card detail (comments, assignees, labels, etc.) accessible via open button; adding a sub-card creates a card number in the same project
- Add start_date field to cards: editable in card detail alongside due_date; stored in database; returned in all card API responses
- Add cross-references between cards: bidirectional links shown in card detail "Linked Cards" section with card number, project key, title, priority, and column; clicking opens linked card in nested detail modal; cross-project references supported
- Add Gantt chart per project: frappe-gantt based view accessible from board toolbar; cards with start/due dates shown as colour-coded priority bars; click to open card detail; drag to update dates; Day/Week/Month view modes
- Fix "Edit customer" showing empty fields: openEdit() now pre-populates form before opening dialog
- Fix switching customers in sidebar not updating overview: added watch(custId) to CustomerDetailView to reload on route param change
- Extend demo seed: start dates, due dates, sub-cards, and cross-reference links added to all demo card sets
- Sidebar drag-to-reorder starred projects and customers: drag handles appear on hover; custom order persisted in localStorage
- All Customers section in sidebar: collapsible list of every customer, starred ones first with a ★ badge; collapsed by default
- Fix card Start Date and Due Date pickers not opening: use overlay input[type=date] behind calendar icon button instead of showPicker() on hidden element
- Fix contract editor date fields ignoring configured date format: Start Date and End Date now use the text-input + overlay-picker pattern with format-aware display and parsing
- Fix deleted projects reappearing in admin list: remove Unscoped() from AdminListProjects so soft-deleted projects are excluded
- Fix deleted project remaining visible in sidebar until refresh: admin delete now immediately filters the project from sidebarStore.allProjects
- Fix seed --reset failing with UNIQUE constraint error when demo projects were previously soft-deleted: collect project IDs via Unscoped() before wiping
- Per-user accent colour setting (blue, red, green, orange): saved to user profile, applied on login, affects buttons, links, and active highlights across the full UI
- Drag-to-reorder sidebar sections: grab handle on each section header; default order is Starred Projects, All Projects, Favourite Customers, All Customers, Favourites, People, Chats; order persisted in localStorage
- Increase whitespace between sidebar sections for readability
- Indent items in All Projects, All Customers, People, and Chats sidebar sections; apply the same indent to empty-state messages throughout the sidebar
- Fix Windows desktop app typing lag during login: register the Ctrl+zoom keydown listener as passive in Tauri so WebView2 skips the synchronous IPC round-trip on every keystroke
- Fix sidebar drag-to-reorder broken on Linux desktop app: replace HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API with pointer events (pointerdown/pointermove/pointerup) because WebKitGTK's DnD support is incomplete; new implementation works on all platforms
- Forgotten password: Forgot password? link on login page sends a one-time reset link by email valid for one hour; requires SMTP; always responds 200 to prevent account enumeration
- Password policy: admin-configurable minimum length (floor 8, default 12), require uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character; enforced on registration, password change, and reset; active requirements shown to users beneath the password field
- Avatar image upload in User Settings: upload an image file directly instead of providing a URL; stored as an attachment on the server
- Raise default password minimum length from 8 to 12 in system settings defaults
- Seed: star all three demo projects and Acme Corporation + Globex Systems for the persistent tonk admin user
- Fix INSTALL.md Go requirement (1.22 → 1.25) and first-admin instructions (first registered user is auto-promoted, no DB update needed)
- Reduce Windows desktop app login-screen typing lag: hide WebView2 password-reveal button (`::-ms-reveal`), disable spellcheck/autocorrect/autocapitalize on credential inputs, and disable WebView2 autofill IPC via ICoreWebView2Settings4 in Tauri Rust setup
- Expand INSTALL.md desktop build prerequisites with per-platform details (Linux: Ubuntu 24.04 required for correct HarfBuzz; macOS: Xcode CLI tools + universal Rust targets; Windows: Go + Node.js + rustup-init.exe + WebView2 pre-installed)
- Allow the card prefix (e.g. PRJ in PRJ-42) to be set when creating a project; auto-generated from the name but fully editable; 1–10 uppercase letters or digits; live preview shown; forced uppercase on input; cannot be changed after creation
- PDF language selector in report export: choose output language (EN/NL/DE/FR/ES) independently of the UI language; Auto follows current locale; persisted in localStorage
- Per-project subtotal shown as white pill badge on the right of each project header bar in exported PDFs, matching the on-screen report
- Fix PDF export HTTP 500 when company logo is a PNG with alpha channel: composite over white before embedding
- Suppress WebSocket close-1005 log noise: normal browser navigation/tab-close event, not an error
- Customer access control: non-admin users only see customers they are explicitly assigned to (strict allowlist — no assignment means not visible, even if the user has no access rows at all); global admins always see everything
- Per-customer admin role: CustomerAccess rows carry a role field ("member" = read-only visibility, "admin" = can also manage contracts and the customer's member list); role is independent of the global role
- Customer member management: GET/PUT /customers/:id/members lets global admins and customer-admins manage who can see a customer and at what role; accessible from a Members section in the customer detail page; self-lockout protection (non-global-admin cannot remove their own admin row)
- Admin UI: customer chip picker in Create/Edit User now shows an M/A badge on each selected chip (click to toggle between member and admin); role is persisted alongside the assignment
- Training seeder (warmdesk-training): CustomerAccess rows created for each trainee (role member, restricted to their own customer); guru00 receives admin-role CustomerAccess for every training customer so they can see and manage all of them without global admin rights; idempotency path applies the same corrections when users already exist; DiceBear 9.x avataaars avatar seeded from username for each guru user
- Enforce unique card prefix (key_prefix) across all projects so card codes like PRJ-42 are unambiguous for GitHub/webhook integrations; uniqueIndex added to the model; auto-generator appends a numeric suffix when the base is taken (WAR → WAR2 → WAR3); duplicate prefixes in existing databases are deduplicated on startup before AutoMigrate runs; prefix is immutable after creation (changing it would invalidate existing commit messages and external refs); git integration regex updated to match digit-suffixed prefixes
- Ansible collection customer_member module: new ansilab.warmdesk.customer_member module manages GET/PUT /customers/:id/members; parameters: customer (name), username, role (member/admin), state (present/absent); full-list sync via PUT; resolves username to user_id via GET /users for new members; check mode aware
- Ansible collection user module: added customer_roles parameter — a dict of {customer_name: role} that performs a full sync of a user's customer assignments via PUT /admin/users/:id/customers; omit to leave assignments unchanged, pass {} to clear all; customer names resolved to IDs via GET /customers; unresolved names emit a warning; works in both CREATE and UPDATE paths
- About modal: nav dropdown "About" item opens a modal showing the frontend version (from __APP_VERSION__ Vite global), server version (fetched from GET /api/v1/version), description, repository link, license, and copyright; the modal fetches the server version itself on mount so it works without wiring through the store
- Resizable Edit User modal in Admin panel: the Edit User modal has resize: both enabled via a new .modal-resizable CSS class; flex column layout keeps the header and footer pinned while the body scrolls; min-width 400px, min-height 300px, max 95vw/90vh
- 7 new UI languages: Danish (da), Swedish (sv), Norwegian Bokmål (nb), Finnish (fi), Icelandic (is), Portuguese (pt), Italian (it); all ~350 translation keys covered; all languages available in the header language selector, the system default locale selector, and the per-user locale selector in Admin → Edit User
- All 12 languages now also available in the per-user locale selector in User Settings and the PDF language selector in the Report view (previously only 5 languages were shown there)
- Show deleted projects in Admin → Projects: a "Show deleted" toggle lists soft-deleted projects with a Deleted badge; a Restore button recovers a project from soft-delete
- Database backup in Admin panel: new Backup / Restore tab (4th tab, alongside Users, Projects, Settings); Create Backup button makes a timestamped copy in ./backups/ using VACUUM INTO for SQLite (atomic, no downtime) or pg_dump/mysqldump for Postgres/MySQL; backup list shows filename, size, and date with Restore and Delete actions; SQLite restore is live (close connection pool, overwrite file, reinit GORM — no server restart); every backup and restore is logged with filename, driver, user ID, and client IP
- Backup role: new global_role value "backup" (alongside admin/user/viewer/metrics); BackupAuth middleware allows admin + backup; dedicated endpoint POST /api/v1/backup triggers a backup via API key for cron jobs and automation scripts; backup role appears in the create-user and users-table role dropdowns in Admin
- Built-in backup scheduler: Admin → Backup / Restore tab; choose interval (every 6 h / 8 h / 12 h / 24 h); configurable retention count; runs server-side without cron; last run and next scheduled run displayed in UI; oldest files pruned automatically when retention limit is reached
- Backup start time: optional HH:MM anchor for the backup scheduler; when set, backups run at fixed time-of-day slots (e.g. start 02:00 + every 6 h → runs at 02:00, 08:00, 14:00, 20:00) instead of drifting with each run
- Package as .deb (Debian/Ubuntu) and .rpm (Fedora/RHEL): make deb and make rpm targets using Tauri's built-in bundlers; .desktop entry and icons included automatically
- Rename Ansible collection namespace from ansilab to ansilabnl
- Ansible Galaxy compliance: add README.md and meta/runtime.yml (requires_ansible: ">=2.14")
- Fix all remaining Ansible DOCUMENTATION YAML parse errors across all modules
- Backup file list: truncate long filenames with ellipsis, widen Size column, correct unit to kB
- Download backup: each backup in Admin → Backup / Restore has a Download button that streams the file to the browser for offsite storage or transfer
- Fix warmdesk-seed --reset crash on fresh database: startup key_prefix migration guard now checks HasTable before attempting ALTER TABLE, so a brand-new or just-wiped database initialises cleanly without "no such table: projects"
- Fix desktop app .desktop file incomplete: add custom Tauri desktop template (warmdesk.desktop) with GenericName, Comment, Keywords, StartupNotify; wire shortDescription and category in tauri.conf.json so Categories and Comment are populated in the installed .desktop entry
- Fix desktopTemplate placement in tauri.conf.json: must be under bundle.linux.deb and bundle.linux.rpm individually in Tauri 2, not bundle.linux directly
- Fix desktop app category: "Office" is not in Tauri's accepted list; changed to "Productivity" (maps to Office; XDG category in the .desktop file)
- Send an email notification after every backup (manual or scheduled): toggle and recipient address in Admin → Backup / Restore; email contains date/time, success/failure status, and a list of all available backups with sizes and dates
- Add backup metrics to Prometheus endpoint: warmdesk_backup_last_run_timestamp_seconds, warmdesk_backup_last_success (1/0/−1), warmdesk_backup_files_total
- Send all outbound emails as HTML with a shared branded template: blue header with company name and logo, content area, footer with WarmDesk icon, version, and instance URL; plain-text fallback included for all emails
- Add dark-mode email support: prefers-color-scheme media queries keep the password-reset button and key elements readable in Apple Mail, iOS Mail, Samsung Mail, and Outlook for Mac in dark mode; border fallback for clients that strip background colours
- Fix email footer showing vv0.7.7 (double v): strip leading v from version tag before rendering
- Fix Gin "trusted all proxies" warning: call SetTrustedProxies(nil) at startup so proxy headers are not trusted by default
- Config file auto-discovery accepts both .yaml and .yml extensions (warmdesk.yaml tried first, falls back to warmdesk.yml)
- Embed company logo as base64 data URI in outbound emails: uploaded logos read from disk, external URLs fetched at send time; works without base_url and survives email clients that block remote images
- Fix company logo not shown in emails when stored as a data URI: pass data: values through directly instead of discarding them
- Add Scrum Story Points: admin toggle enables a story points field on every card detail and a SP badge on card tiles; takes effect immediately without a page reload
- Add customer filter on the project dashboard: selector appears when projects span multiple customers; drag-to-reorder suppressed while filtered
- Auth audit logging: login, logout, failed login, registration, password change/reset, MFA enable/disable/verify events written to server log with user ID, username, and client IP
- Admin permanently delete project: hard-delete a soft-deleted project and all its data from Admin → Projects (deleted tab); safe — only available after soft-delete
- Four selectable chat layouts (Bubble, Comfortable, Compact, Cozy) in project chat panel and DM view; choice persisted in localStorage
- In-app new-message toast: dismissible pop-up in chat when a message arrives from someone else; controlled by bell toggle in chat header; persisted in localStorage
- OS desktop notifications: native OS notification when a message arrives and the window is not focused; uses browser Notifications API; respects the bell toggle
- Document-title unread indicator: tab title shows ● WarmDesk when there are unread messages, reverts when all read
- Fix backup email filename invisible on light backgrounds (missing text colour on filename column)
- Sprint date fields now respect user date format (overlay date-picker pattern)
- Fix false-positive unread DM indicator on every login (conversations seeded to current updated_at on first load)
- Fix unread dot reappearing for actively-read conversations (markConvSeen called on every poll when user is at bottom)
- Fix Admin permanently delete button doing nothing (missing useI18n import in AdminView.vue)
- Remove 480px max-width cap on DM message bubbles so wide content (ASCII tables, code) uses full available width
- Sidebar unread check split to dedicated 5-second interval; presence/user-list poll remains at 10 seconds
- Native desktop notifications in Tauri app via tauri-plugin-notification (libnotify on Linux); browser falls back to Web Notifications API
- trusted_proxies config setting (TRUSTED_PROXIES env var): comma-separated IPs/CIDRs for reverse-proxy trust so auth logs show real client IPs; documented in warmdesk.yaml.example
- Grouped chat layout (fifth option alongside Bubble/Comfortable/Compact/Cozy): consecutive messages from the same sender within 5 minutes collapse avatar and name to first message only, Discord/Mattermost style
- Paste images into chat: Ctrl+V in the compose textarea pastes clipboard images as pending attachments; local object-URL preview shown before send; works in DM view and project chat panel
- Inline image display: attached images render at up to 520×480 px directly in the message; attachment URLs include ?token= so <img> tags authenticate without custom headers
- Compose textarea retains keyboard focus after sending a message
- Card references in chat: typing #PRJ-42 renders a clickable badge; click navigates to the card; Ctrl/middle-click opens a new tab; backend resolves prefix+number via GET /api/v1/cards/resolve/:ref
- Fix Tauri .desktop file empty Name/Comment/StartupWMClass: Tauri v2 does not substitute {{app_name}} or {{short_description}} placeholders; values hardcoded in template
- Ansible collection project module supports board_type (kanban or scrum) at creation time; collection bumped to v0.2.0
- Board silently refreshes on WebSocket reconnect so cards created via API during a dropped connection appear automatically without a manual reload
- Fix favicon: replace CoWorker indigo Kanban-columns icon with WarmDesk desk-and-cup motif in green brand colours
- Prevent admin from deleting their own account: backend returns 403 and the Delete button is disabled in Admin → Users for the logged-in user's own row
- Ansible collection: new api_key lookup plugin lists personal or project-scoped API keys enriched with username and display_name; filter by key name or return all
- Hide Deactivate and Delete buttons for the logged-in admin's own row in Admin → Users (previously Delete was disabled but still visible; Deactivate was fully functional)
- Swagger UI: /swagger and /swagger/ redirect to /swagger/index.html so typing index.html is no longer needed
- Fix Swagger startup panic: remove /swagger/ route that conflicted with Gin's /*any wildcard; gin-swagger handles the trailing-slash redirect internally
- Restore Gravatar avatars with an admin toggle to enable/disable them; fall back to DiceBear initials avatars when disabled
- Rate-limit auth endpoints: 10 login/MFA attempts per 15 minutes, 5 registrations per hour, 5 password resets per 30 minutes
- Add security response headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy)
- Write structured audit log lines for all authentication events
- Validate uploaded image files against magic bytes to reject MIME-type spoofing
- Fix login-page redirect loop: token-refresh interceptor no longer reloads the page when already on /login
- Pass PGPASSWORD via environment variable for pg_dump instead of embedding credentials in the DSN argument
- Add random hex suffix to backup filenames to prevent same-minute overwrites
- Issue httpOnly SameSite=Strict cookies for browser auth flows; add POST /auth/logout to clear them server-side
- Accept access-token cookie for WebSocket upgrades in browser mode
- Enforce allowed_origins list in the WebSocket upgrader
- Raise search minimum to 3 characters and strip SQL LIKE wildcards from queries
- Remove ?api_key= query param support; require X-API-Key header for API key authentication
- Log a warning when allowed_origins is set to wildcard (*)
- Fix Windows CI build: remove FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24 from all GitHub Actions workflows
- Add per-user time tracking module: optional toggle in User Settings; weekly grid (Exact Online-style) with customer/project/activity rows and day columns; week navigation; add, edit, and delete rows; day and row totals; grand total
- Time tracking report tab: period selector (week/month/year), grouped entries, subtotals, grand total
- Export weekly timesheet and report to XLSX (SheetJS) and PDF (backend gofpdf, all 12 languages)
- Move "Time Spent" from card form to per-comment: optional hours/minutes input when writing a comment; card shows running total; auto-creates a TimeEntry (today's date, card's project and customer, first sentence as description) when user has time tracking enabled
- Highlight overdue board cards with a subtle orange background and border tint (distinct from the red date text)
- Enforce customer on every project: required at creation (create-project dialog and API) and at update (project settings); blank option removed from project settings customer selector
- Re-check server and GitHub versions every hour while logged in (previously only on startup)
- Vite manualChunks bundle split: Vue core, i18n, markdown, HTTP libs moved to named chunks; main JS bundle reduced from ~504 kB to ~298 kB
- Demo seed: add 60 time entries across 5 users spanning 2 weeks; enable time tracking for all five active demo users
- Refuse to start if jwt_secret is still the default value or if allowed_origins contains wildcard in release mode
- Add HSTS and Content-Security-Policy headers to nginx and Apache reverse-proxy templates (for deployments behind a reverse proxy)
- Detect uploaded file MIME type from file bytes server-side; ignore client-supplied Content-Type
- Pin bcrypt password hashing cost to 12 (raised from library default of 10)
- Default gin_mode to release; require explicit opt-in for debug mode
- Add API IP allowlist system setting: restrict access to comma-separated IPs or CIDR ranges from the admin panel
- Apply IP allowlist to Swagger UI routes alongside the API
- Replace ?token= query param in WebSocket URLs and attachment image URLs with short-lived purpose-limited tickets (30 s WS ticket, 5 min media ticket) so the long-lived JWT never appears in server logs or browser history
- Sanitise handler error responses: replace raw err.Error() output with generic messages to prevent leaking internal paths or driver details
- Add drag-to-reorder for checklist items via ⠿ handle; new position saved immediately via a dedicated PATCH reorder endpoint
- Broadcast checklist changes (add, tick, edit, delete, reorder) over WebSocket so all users viewing the same card see updates in real time
- Show a ← [parent card title] back link at the top of sub-card and linked-card nested modals to return to the originating card
- Add ARM64 server build targets (make build-arm64) and ARM64 Tauri desktop targets (appimage-arm64, deb-arm64, rpm-arm64)
- Add make help target listing all build targets grouped by category
- Fix version label alignment on the login page
- Show WarmDesk wordmark next to logo on the login screen
- Fix company logo URL not resolving to absolute path in Tauri desktop client
- Admin Users table: add Last Password Change column and dedicated MFA column (moved from Status badge)
- Admin Settings: password_change_period_days policy; login flags expired passwords and redirects to Settings with a warning banner
- People list in DM/chat: non-admin users with explicit customer assignments only see colleagues in shared customers
- Admin tables (Users, Groups, Customers, Projects): sortable name column with ↑/↓ toggle
- Edit User modal in Admin: group assignment chip picker alongside existing project and customer pickers; shows and saves current group memberships
- Reaction pills in chat and DMs: hover tooltip shows names of all users who reacted ("You, Alice, Bob")
- Fix column drag-to-reorder for project owners/admins: Sortable is now enabled reactively once member list loads, not just at board init time
- F5 and Ctrl+F5 reload the page in the Tauri desktop client
- Fix IP allowlist: only apply to X-API-Key requests, not browser/JWT sessions; prevents admin self-lockout
- Fix training seeder --reset: was matching wrong group name pattern, leaving orphaned groups that crashed re-runs
- Fix training seeder group creation to be idempotent (FirstOrCreate)
- Expand training seeder character list: 21 new Monty Python / Arthurian characters, two duplicates removed
- Add Black theme (true #000 background) for OLED screens; available alongside Light, Dark, and System in Settings
- Fix dark mode native select dropdowns: declare color-scheme on :root and [data-theme="dark"] so browser-native dropdowns render correctly
- Fix stray text insertion cursor on UI chrome: user-select: none on body, restored only for inputs and textareas
- Fix blinking caret in login branding panel: re-focus login input after async branding loads and layout switches from plain to split
- Increase login branding panel logo max size from 180x120px to 240x180px for more visual presence with breathing room retained
- Demo seeder now seeds company_name, company_logo, and login_branding_enabled so the branded login panel is active after seeding
- About modal now mentions both Kanban and Scrum boards in the description
- Add ⋮ sections visibility menu to card detail: toggle Labels, Tags, Attachments, Checklist, Sub-cards, Linked Cards, Watchers on/off; sections hidden by default when empty; can only be turned off when empty; preferences persisted in localStorage
- Show avatars for both primary assignee and extra assignees on board card tiles (stacked, max 3 + overflow counter)
- Rename "Assignees" chip picker to "Extra Assignees" to distinguish from primary assignee dropdown
- Filter primary assignee out of Extra Assignees chip list; auto-remove from extra assignees when selected as primary
- Fix clearing primary assignee (selecting "—") not persisting on Save: backend was skipping null assignee_id; changed to json.RawMessage with explicit null handling matching the date field pattern
- Upgrade Vite 5 → 8 and @vitejs/plugin-vue 5 → 6; rename rollupOptions → rolldownOptions in vite.config.js
- Fix invalid :deep() usage in global CSS and double-:deep() chains in scoped components; eliminates Vite 8 / lightningcss warnings
- Bump postcss to 8.5.12 (resolves moderate XSS advisory GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93)
- Fix WebSocket connections rejected for same-origin clients in production: allow connections from browsers where Origin matches the backend host
- Fix new cards not appearing on board until page refresh: board store adds the card immediately after API response; WS broadcast deduplication prevents double insertion
- Add separate light/dark company logos for login screen branding: admin sets two logos (light background and dark background); login page switches logo live when theme changes, including OS preference changes in system mode
- Show company logo and name in the Time Tracking report header (matches main Time Report style)
- Include company logo and name in time-tracking PDF export; resolve static frontend assets (e.g. /logo.svg) in addition to uploaded files
- Fix PDF export employee name: show the target employee's name (not the exporter's) when an admin exports for a specific person; show translated "All Employees" label when exporting across all users
- Fix sidebar indentation: "All Projects" and "All Customers" items now indent to the same level as starred/favourite items
- Fix time-tracking weekly sheet in dark/black themes: replace all hardcoded light colours with CSS custom properties
- Align time-tracking report columns across groups using table-layout: fixed and shared colgroup widths
- Fix backup email HTML rendering: row background colours moved from <tr> to each <td>/<th> with background-color so alternating-row shading renders in all email clients
- Git issue linking on cards: optional ExternalIssueURL and ExternalIssueRef fields on each card; reference auto-filled from URL path (/issues/, /pull/, /merge_requests/); toggled via card ⋮ sections menu
- Group team chat: every user group has a linked Conversation (IsGroup=true) created on save; membership kept in sync; rename/avatar propagated; deletion cleans up conversation; one-time startup migration for existing groups
- Sort card ⋮ sections menu options alphabetically by translated label
- PDF font and language selects in Time Tracking: weekly sheet export bar and Report tab filter bar both show PDF Font and PDF Language dropdowns (same options as main Time Report); persisted in localStorage; passed to backend PDF generator
- 1:1 audio and video calls via WebRTC: call button in DM header; peer-to-peer with STUN; signaling over existing WebSocket; audio-only fallback when camera unavailable; incoming call overlay with ringtone, accept/decline; full-screen video overlay with remote video + mirrored self-preview PiP + gradient controls bar; slim audio bar with live timer for voice-only calls
- Call settings dropdown: chevron next to call button opens floating panel with mic selector + live input-level bar, camera selector + live mirrored preview, speaker selector + test-tone button; device preferences persisted in localStorage; speaker section hidden when setSinkId unsupported (Linux Tauri)
- Fix ringtone playing when chatting: IncomingCallOverlay used onMounted to start ringtone but is always mounted in App.vue; changed to watch on call phase so ringtone only plays when phase becomes 'ringing'
- Demo seeder creates group conversations at seed time: each group gets its linked Conversation and ConversationMember rows during seeding, not relying on the startup migration
- Online presence in DM view: green dot on 1:1 conversation avatars + "Online/Offline" status line in chat header; uses sidebar store chatUsers (10s poll)
- Fix call hang-up race condition: startCall and acceptCall now check phase after await _getMedia so cancelling during permission prompt correctly aborts the call; 45s auto-cancel timeout added for unanswered outgoing calls
- Fix WebSocket reconnect robustness: Tauri mode retries after ticket-fetch failure; browser mode silently refreshes token before each reconnect to survive 15-minute JWT expiry
- Show error toast on call failure: "unavailable" (callee offline) and "no_mic" (microphone denied) errors now surface a toast instead of the call bar silently disappearing
- Fix chat layout: chat panel and Direct Messages view fill available height correctly with input anchored to bottom
- Fix nginx WebSocket Connection header: quote "upgrade" value per HTTP spec in provided nginx template
- Reduce presence poll interval from 10 s to 5 s for faster online/offline updates; extract as named constant
- Fix blank screen under CSP: add unsafe-eval to script-src in nginx/Apache templates; vue-i18n runtime message compiler requires new Function() and was blocked by the previous policy
- Fix update checker blocked by CSP: add https://api.github.com to connect-src in nginx/Apache templates
- Show toast when callee declines an outgoing call: "{name} declined the call" error toast appears instead of call bar silently disappearing; all 12 locales covered
- Fix call error toasts dropped by phase race: watch errorMsg directly instead of phase so declined/unavailable/no_mic toasts always fire even when ring timeout races the signal
- Add video toggle button to audio call bar: camera on/off button appears in the slim bottom bar when the call has a video track; matches mute button style and uses same toggleCamera action
- Fix call error toasts still not appearing: useI18n and useUIStore were missing imports in ActiveCallBar.vue so every toast attempt threw a silent runtime error; both now properly imported
- Add LiveKit token endpoint: GET /api/v1/conversations/:id/livekit-token issues a signed LiveKit JWT for the conversation room; membership-checked; returns 503 when livekit_api_key/secret not configured
- Add LiveKit config fields: livekit_url, livekit_api_key, livekit_api_secret with LIVEKIT_URL/LIVEKIT_API_KEY/LIVEKIT_API_SECRET env var overrides; documented in warmdesk.yaml.example
- Add in-call attendee invite: a + button in the bottom controls bar of any active video or audio call opens a searchable user picker with multi-select; selected users receive a real-time invite popup (IncomingGroupCallOverlay) and join the LiveKit group room with one click; backend adds invitees to the conversation and relays call.group_invite via personal WebSocket
- Upgrade 1:1 call to group when inviting: clicking + during a 1:1 WebRTC call sends the group invite to selected users and to the existing call partner, ends the WebRTC call, and joins the LiveKit room automatically
- Fix Apache WebSocket proxy timeout: replace RewriteRule-based WebSocket handling with a dedicated <Location "/api/v1/ws"> block using ProxyPass ws:// and ProxyTimeout 86400; prevents silent 5-minute disconnects under default Apache settings
- Fix backup email size unit: display kB (correct SI prefix, lowercase k) instead of KB; add white-space:nowrap to size and date columns so narrow email clients do not wrap "548.0 kB" across two lines
- Add "All Customers" collapsible section to sidebar: lists every customer with starred ones sorted first and marked; mirrors the existing "All Projects" section
- Add drag-to-reorder for starred customers in sidebar via ⠿ handle (pointer events — works on Linux/WebKitGTK); order persisted in localStorage
- Add livekit_room_prefix config option (LIVEKIT_ROOM_PREFIX env var): prepends a prefix to every LiveKit room name to avoid collisions when sharing a server across multiple WarmDesk instances
- Harden external image proxy: resolve DNS once and verify every IP is a publicly routable address, then dial by IP directly (prevents DNS-rebinding attacks); re-encode query strings so reserved characters in parameters (e.g. DiceBear seed names with spaces or commas) do not produce malformed requests; validate Content-Type header and reject non-image responses
- Rate-limit external image proxy endpoint: 200 requests per 10 minutes per IP to prevent unauthenticated bandwidth abuse
- Tauri desktop: load external images (Gravatar, DiceBear, etc.) directly instead of via the same-origin proxy; WebKit's tauri:// origin treats proxied HTTP responses as mixed content and blocks them
- Enable video call button in all group chats regardless of member count; remove the previous 3-member minimum
- Fix Linux AppImage camera and microphone: bundle all GStreamer 1.24 plugins and set GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0 and GST_REGISTRY so the AppImage's plugins take precedence over incompatible system GStreamer installations on Fedora and other non-Ubuntu distributions
- Use camera icon for 1:1 call button to match the group chat button
- Fix backup email filename wrapping and raw timestamp: long filenames no longer wrap mid-word; backup date displays as readable date/time instead of a Unix timestamp
- Fix backup email filename wrapping in HTML viewers: wrap filenames in <nobr> so w3m, lynx, and Mutt's HTML viewer no longer break the filename mid-hash at narrow terminal widths
- Accept 'Name <address>' format in SMTP From setting: smtp_from now accepts RFC 5322 display-name form in addition to plain addresses; envelope address extracted automatically for smtp.SendMail
- Use monospace font for all columns in the Available backups email table: Size and Date columns now match the Filename column; header row also monospace
- GPG-sign all release artifacts: every file attached to a GitHub release has a companion detached armoured .asc signature; signing is conditional on GPG_SIGNING_KEY and GPG_KEY_ID secrets being set in the repository
- Fix GPG signing in headless CI: configure pinentry-mode loopback and restart gpg-agent after import so signing works without a TTY
- Fix GPG signing batchmode passphrase error: pass --passphrase from GPG_PASSPHRASE secret so keys with a passphrase work without interactive prompting
- Fix external avatar 502 errors in web app: media proxy returns 302 redirect to original URL when server cannot reach upstream host instead of 502; browsers follow redirect and load image directly
- Fix CSP font-src blocking inlined fonts: add data: to font-src in nginx and Apache deploy templates so Vite-bundled woff2/woff data-URI fonts are allowed
- Fix CSP img-src blocking external avatars: add https: to img-src in nginx and Apache deploy templates so Gravatar, DiceBear, and other external avatar images load when the proxy redirects to them
- Fix customer logo proxy 400 when hostname resolves to internal IP: return 302 redirect to original URL instead of 400 when resolveAndVerify rejects a host; browser loads the image directly, server-side SSRF protection still holds
- Show "no one online" error for group video call: clicking the group call button when no other members are online now shows a toast message instead of silently joining an empty room
- App: replace theme cycle button in app navbar with a Light / Dark / System dropdown; active option highlighted; persisted to user profile
- Close user menu immediately when any item is selected instead of requiring an extra click elsewhere to dismiss it
- Fix PDF and XLSX report export in the Tauri desktop app: open a native OS save dialog using tauri-plugin-dialog and tauri-plugin-fs; the previous anchor-download approach was silently ignored by the WebView
- Close all popups and overlays with Escape: About dialog, Call Settings panel, Emoji reaction picker, and incoming call / group call notifications; the call chat sidebar shows an inline discard-draft confirmation before closing when a message has been typed
- Website: add Light / Dark / System theme switcher to marketing website navbar; dark mode CSS variables applied throughout; system mode follows OS preference; choice persisted in localStorage

- Allow users and admins to create time-tracking-only projects (no board created) for use in the weekly timesheet
- Allow users and admins to create time-tracking-only customers (no CRM record created) that can be associated with time-tracking-only projects
- Manage time-tracking projects and customers via a tabbed modal (⚙ button) in the time-tracking view with full CRUD support
- All UI must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Group time-tracking report entries by Period, Customer, Project, or Customer & Project via a selector in the report filters; grouping is applied in PDF and XLSX exports
- Copy previous week rows to the current week in the Log Time tab with a single button; only the row definitions are copied (no hours), and copying is scoped to the displayed week
- Add a Today button to the week navigator to jump back to the current week in one click
- Sort Log Time rows by Customer/Project or Activity by clicking the column header; clicking again toggles direction; the day columns always follow their row
- Add a "Remember me" checkbox to the login page that saves the email/username in the browser's local storage and restores it on the next visit
- Add passkey (WebAuthn) sign-in: register passkeys (Touch ID, Windows Hello, hardware security keys) in User Settings and sign in passwordlessly from the login page using discoverable credentials; browser-only (Tauri desktop excluded)
- Add time notation user setting: choose between decimal (8.25) and HH:MM (8:15) for the weekly timesheet; preference saved to user profile; all calculations remain in minutes
- Fix time-tracking PDF: "Date" column header now translated in all 12 languages; month names in period labels translated; DMY date order used for all non-English locales
- Fix desktop app time-tracking PDF and XLSX export: all four export buttons now open a native OS save dialog via tauri-plugin-dialog and tauri-plugin-fs; previously silently dropped (XLSX) or errored (PDF)
- Fix desktop app PDF/XLSX export error: switch binary download endpoints from responseType:'blob' to responseType:'arraybuffer' to avoid unreliable response.blob() in Tauri's HTTP plugin
- Fix desktop app PDF and XLSX export in Linux AppImage: WebKit GTK2 throws TypeError on all response body methods (arrayBuffer, text, blob, getReader) for ReadableStream-backed Responses produced by tauri-plugin-http; bypass WebKit entirely with a new fetch_binary_b64 Rust command that fetches via reqwest and returns base64; JS decodes with atob()
- Fix desktop app save dialog default path: open in user home directory instead of AppImage mount path
- Desktop app remembers last export directory: save dialog opens in the last-used export folder (stored in localStorage); falls back to home directory on first use
- Fix attachment IDOR: verify project membership or conversation participation before serving any attachment download
- Fix Content-Disposition header injection: escape quotes and backslashes in attachment filenames before inserting into the header
- Add HSTS and Content-Security-Policy response headers to every Go server response (complements the proxy-template headers above; ensures headers are present when WarmDesk is accessed directly without a reverse proxy)
- Block CORS wildcard origin at middleware level in addition to startup check
- Enforce minimum 32-character length for jwt_secret at startup
- Rate-limit direct-message and conversation message-send endpoints (60 req/min per IP)
- Mask password-reset token in audit log: log only the first 8 characters followed by ellipsis
- Make all icon-only buttons WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with aria-label across board, card detail, chat, call, time-tracking, dashboard, admin, and layout components
- Add aria-label to all unlabelled inputs and selects
- Add aria-hidden to decorative SVGs throughout the frontend
- Add full ARIA tablist/tab/tabpanel roles to time-tracking mode tabs and chat layout picker
- Make hover-only interactive elements keyboard-accessible via focus-visible and focus-within CSS rules
- Replace hard-coded colour values with CSS custom properties in frontend components
- Fix time-tracking sheet row sorting: rows no longer re-sort while entering time; order is stable and only changes when the user clicks a column header
- Sort personal time-tracking projects alphabetically by name in the manage modal
- Add quick-nav strip to the app header with links to Dashboard, News, Chats, Reports, and Time Tracking; active page highlighted; permission-gated items hidden for users without access; strip hidden below 960px viewport width
- Add undeclarable minutes field to time-tracking-only projects: set in the ⚙ manage modal as HH:MM; automatically subtracted from totals in the weekly sheet (row badge, sheet footer), report tab, PDF, and XLSX export; result is never below zero
- Show undeclarable and declarable rows in time-tracking report when grouped by Customer: per-customer undeclarable line below each group subtotal, grand total undeclarable line at the bottom
- Add PDF page-break per customer option: checkbox in export controls (visible when group_by=customer); each customer page repeats the full document header (logo, company, title, period, employee); grand total omitted in page-per-customer mode
- Add day-of-week abbreviation option to PDF time-tracking export: prepend localised day abbreviation (Mon–Sun) before each date; abbreviation rendered in a fixed-width sub-cell so dates stay aligned for all 12 supported languages
- Group PDF export options in a dropdown button (Export options) with all settings persisted to localStorage; day-of-week toggle and per-customer page-break toggle shown together
- Add personal TT-only seed data for tonk: customers Smart Owl Consulting and Personal, projects Travel (45 min undeclarable), Holidays (480 min), Study & Training, Internal (60 min), with 14 sample time entries; --reset cleans them up
- Fix time-tracking week header date mismatch in UTC+ timezones: use local date components instead of toISOString() so column dates and day abbreviations always agree
- Add public holidays to time tracking: dropdown in the week navigation bar lists 12 countries by flag and native name; clicking a country adds 0-minute holiday entries for the current year; skip existing entries and report added vs. skipped count
- Highlight holiday entries in the sheet: amber background on day column headers (with glowing dot), amber row background, and stronger amber on the specific day cell
- Fix backup download in Tauri desktop app: use fetchBinary + triggerDownload so the native save dialog opens correctly on Linux
- Leave time entry cells blank when value is 0:00 to reduce visual noise; placeholder still shows on focus
- Replace emoji flag characters in holidays dropdown with CSS gradient badges approximating each country's flag colours; works on Linux without a colour emoji font
- Add calendar date-picker to week label in time tracking: clicking "Week 14 2026" opens a month calendar popover with week numbers; click any day or week number to jump to that week
- Fix time entry cell placeholder rendering on Tauri/GTK WebKit: hide placeholder by default, show faintly on focus only
- Update all dependencies to latest: Go 1.26, Vue 3.5.34, Pinia 3, Vue Router 5, vue-i18n 11, marked 18, Vite 8, Tauri 2.11, and all npm packages
- Speed up AppImage builds with sccache (Rust compilation cache) and mold linker
- Fix CI build pipeline broken after dependency upgrade: install clang and mold on GitHub Actions runners, suppress sccache wrapper (not installed on runners) with RUSTC_WRAPPER="" in all client and release workflows
- Add week start day preference to time tracking: users can choose Monday or Sunday as the first day of the week in Settings; drives the sheet view, week-picker calendar, current-week detection, and XLSX/PDF exports
- Fix week start preference not persisting: wire week_start into the PUT /auth/me handler so the setting is actually saved
- Add card_ref to ansilabnl.warmdesk.card return value: the full card reference (e.g. GF00-4) is now returned so it can be passed as card_number in follow-up tasks
- Fix Ansible assignee lookup with project-scoped API keys: fall back to GET /projects/{slug}/members on 403; accept username or email address as assignee value
- Add closed parameter to ansilabnl.warmdesk.card Ansible module: set closed: true/false to open or close a card; idempotent
- Add card activity history panel to card detail: full audit timeline of created, commented, field changes, column moves, and open/close events with timestamps and user attribution
- Add ansilabnl.warmdesk.card_comment Ansible module: create, update, or delete card comments identified by project slug and card number
- Fix media proxy panic when upstream hostname resolves to an IPv6 address: bracket IPv6 literals in dial-target URL and handle request-construction errors
- Proxy /uploads through Vite dev server so project avatar images load correctly during local development
- Add maximize/restore button to card detail modal: fills the full viewport on click; second click restores previous size
- Fix card modal clipped at high browser zoom: make modal backdrop the scroll container so the full card is always reachable
- Ansible card module: added `time_spent` option to log time (in minutes) against a card
- Ansible card_comment module: renamed `time_spent_minutes` to `time_spent` for consistency
- Ansible collection: new `user_options` module for managing per-user preferences
- Admin API: `PUT /api/v1/admin/users/:id` now accepts `time_tracking_enabled`, `theme`, `show_breadcrumbs`, `email_notifications`

- Add SLA policies: admin-configurable response and resolution time limits with optional priority filter; auto-applied to new tickets; breach status tracked per ticket
- Custom themed DatePicker component for date fields (respects user date format and week-start, works in all themes)
- User setting: dashboard default (boards or tickets); ticket option redirects to first starred customer's ticket list
- News widget shown on ticket list page so helpdesk-first users don't miss announcements
- Demo seed: add direct CustomerAccess entries for all demo customers so ticket assignee dropdown is populated

- Fix markdown list indentation missing in ticket/news/dashboard views (moved .markdown-body ul/ol styles to global CSS)
- Ansible collection v0.4.0: new ticket, sla_policy, and user_access modules
- Add time logging on tickets: users can log time entries directly on a ticket (gated by time_tracking_enabled), with a project selector populated from the customer's contracts and unassigned projects
- Fix Playwright screenshot suite: dismiss welcome/news backdrop before every screenshot (not just before clicks), change test.describe.serial to test.describe so one failure does not abort the whole suite, add dismissWelcome() helper used consistently across all 20 tests
- Update website homepage: add Helpdesk & Ticketing feature card, add ticket list and ticket detail screenshots to the gallery, update hero subtitle to mention helpdesk ticketing with SLA
- Add Hugo blog post about the helpdesk ticketing system with screenshots

- Fix black theme not persisted: backend theme validation now accepts 'black' alongside light/dark/system
- Add helpdesk ticket and SLA policy endpoints to Bruno and Postman collections: 14 Bruno requests in docs/bruno/helpdesk/ (list, create, get, update, delete ticket; add message; add/remove tags; list/create/delete ticket links; list/create/delete card links) and 4 in docs/bruno/helpdesk-admin/ (SLA policy CRUD); both Postman environment files updated with customerId, ticketId, tagId, linkId, slaPolicyId variables
- Add duplicate row button in time tracking: ⧉ clones a row with auto-incrementing (copy)/(copy 2) suffix, inserted directly below the original
- Add drag handles to time tracking rows: grab the ⠿ handle to manually reorder rows; order persisted in localStorage and restored across sessions
- Fix time tracking rows jumping: entryRows computed now sorts by minimum entry ID ascending (creation order) instead of following the API's date-desc ordering; editing a duplicated row's description/project preserves its position in _keyOrder instead of jumping to the bottom
- Fix Backspace in time tracking cells: only clears the cell when all text is selected (initial focus state); otherwise deletes one character, matching spreadsheet behaviour
- Fix sidebar resize handle blocked by overflow clipping: move overflow-y:auto from .app-sidebar to an inner .sidebar-scroll wrapper so the handle at right:-3px is never clipped and the scrollbar no longer covers it
- Style ticket group count badge to match board column card-count pill (--color-primary, 9999px radius, 11px/600)

- Fix Escape key not closing week picker and holidays dropdown in time tracking: add onNavEscapeKey document handler that closes both popups on Escape
- Add "What's new" strip to website homepage: a tinted band between hero and features showing current release highlights pulled from hugo.toml release_highlights param; updated each release alongside warmdesk_version and release_date
- Fix time tracking row drag-and-drop stopping after week navigation: watch tbodyEl template ref and destroy/recreate Sortable whenever Vue replaces the tbody element on week load
- Merge Board report into Time Tracking as third tab: extract ReportView into BoardReportPanel.vue, embed as "Board" tab in TimeTrackingView, redirect /reports → /time-tracking?tab=board-report, remove duplicate Reports nav entry from AppHeader
- Add PDF export toggles for page numbers and undeclarable time: show_page_numbers and show_undeclarable query params (default on), checkboxes in export options panel, persisted in localStorage
- Move PDF font and language selects into export options popover to prevent filter bar wrapping at HD resolution

- Add move ticket between customers: reassign an inbox ticket to a customer, or move an existing ticket to a different customer from the ticket detail view
- Fix IMAP test connection to use current form values instead of last saved settings
- Add real-time inbox refresh: broadcast ticket.created and ticket.message.added WebSocket events from the IMAP service; InboxView reloads its list and TicketDetailView refreshes incoming replies in-place without clearing the reply draft
- Add macro system for helpdesk tickets: create reusable macros with set_status, set_priority, set_type, add_tag, add_message actions; apply from dropdown in ticket detail; admin CRUD in Settings → Macros tab
- Add macro placeholder expansion: add_message actions support {email}, {fname}, {name}, {subject}, {ticket_id}, {agent}, {agent_fname} with clickable insertion chips in the macro editor; applied macros pre-fill the reply box instead of posting immediately
- Add spam handling: mark ticket as spam sets is_spam=true and closes it; spam tickets hidden from lists by default; Show/Hide Spam toggle in ticket list and inbox headers; Not Spam restores status to open
- Add card/group/list views to Inbox matching the customer ticket list layout, with independent localStorage persistence
- Enlarge reply box to 8 rows (min 180 px) and add a Cancel button to clear the draft and pending attachments

- Fix time tracking tab bar: keep Log Time/Report/Board tabs right-aligned with the gear icon at the far right via margin-left:auto on the tab group
- Fix backup Start time input alignment and time tracking export controls bottom-alignment
- Add get_warmdesk update script to server tarball: auto-detects architecture (amd64/arm64), downloads latest release from GitHub, stops/starts systemd service, uses $(id -u) root check and then/do on own lines
- Fix time range popup clipping: flip to open downward when trigger cell is within 200px of the top of the viewport
- Sync admin guide, user guide, release.md, repository-layout.md, and api.md with current feature set

- Fix grid PDF row label to fall back to activity description when no customer or project is linked
- Replace Grid PDF dropdown with a period-picker panel: segmented Week/Month/Year control with date selectors (week number + year, month name + year, or year alone) initialised from the current view
- Add vertical grid lines to all data rows in grid PDFs and a horizontal border below the totals row across week, month, and year grids
- Fix timesheet new-row editor missing drag-handle cell causing column shift when adding a row

- Add scripts/inject_time.py: bulk time-entry injection CLI with customer/project lookup, MFA support, dry-run mode, and time-based token refresh
- Fix settings view blank screen: escape bare @ in req_special i18n string to {'@'} in all 12 languages so vue-i18n does not treat it as a linked-message reference
- Fix grid PDF customer/project label columns: widen year (60→74 mm) and week (60→74 mm) using available page space; month computes label width dynamically from days in the month; remove phantom empty columns for short months; recalibrate truncation limits from measured font metrics
- Add ticket viewers: avatar row at the bottom of every ticket (customer and inbox) showing who viewed it and when; upsert via ON CONFLICT on (ticket_id, user_id) so each user appears once with their last view time
- Fix date/time format consistency: replace native <input type="date/time"> and raw ISO interpolations in board report, time-tracking personal report, Charts release picker, and contract slot time inputs with useDateFormat()-based equivalents
- Fix backup schedule start time: replace native <input type="time"> with text input using parse-and-reformat logic; also fix backupLastRun/backupNextRun computed names that were mismatched with template references

- Show undeclarable time inline in weekly timesheet grid cells: red amount below logged time, footer total row shows net declarable with undeclarable deducted in red
- Show declarable vs. undeclarable in week/month/year grid PDF exports: declarable as primary value per cell, red undeclarable sub-row below totals; per-cell undeclarable labels in week PDF
- Add multi-profile support to the Tauri desktop app: each profile has its own isolated WebView data directory (localStorage, cookies, session); manage profiles with --create-profile <name> [--label <label>], --list-profiles, --set-default <name>, --delete-profile <name>, --profile <name>; window title shows "WarmDesk — <label>" for non-default profiles
- Extend in-app contextual help to Kanban board, helpdesk inbox, all six project settings tabs (general, members, labels, API keys, webhooks, deleted cards), and all chart types (velocity, burndown, burnup, CFD, sprint report, epic burndown, release burndown, cycle time, lead time); add inline HelpIcon field hints for undeclarable time, report group-by, and export in the time tracking view
- Add metrics global role for read-only Prometheus scraper accounts; accept Authorization: ApiKey <key> header so Prometheus scrape_configs work natively without a reverse proxy
- Expose warmdesk_metrics_last_access_timestamp_seconds and warmdesk_metrics_last_access_success gauges; record scrape history in system_settings; display last-access time using the user's date/time format in the admin panel
- Add admin API key management: create, list, and revoke API keys for any user from the edit-user modal; service accounts no longer need admin access to get a key
- Add soft-delete and restore users: deleted users are soft-deleted and recoverable via a "Show deleted" toggle; permanent purge nullifies FK references on content records and removes personal/membership rows
- Improve in-app contextual help for Project Settings, System Settings, and Customers & Contracts with full tab coverage and eleven new inline field hints; teleport HelpIcon popovers to body to prevent sidebar clipping
- Add MFA trusted devices: after successful TOTP verification, users can trust their device for 7 or 30 days; subsequent logins skip the MFA challenge; trust tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes with httpOnly SameSite=Strict cookies; Settings shows all active trusted devices with last-used and expiry dates and supports individual and bulk revoke; logout automatically revokes the trust record for the current device
- Fix grid PDF exports to respect the user's date/time format setting in the week period label and year print date
- Fix grid PDF exports to respect the user's time notation setting (decimal or hh:mm) for all cell values, totals, and undeclarable rows
- Add MFA remember-devices admin policy (disabled / 1 week / 1 week or 1 month) with automatic trust purge when tightened; passkey login and Tauri honour the policy
- Fix undeclarable timesheet alignment: day-cell deductions right-align with entered time; row totals show declarable time; consistent `-` prefix in UI and PDF exports; screen-reader labels via aria-describedby
- Fix page help for time-tracking sheet (array i18n keys, modal scroll, declarable vs logged totals); add screenshot 24 for undeclarable grid documentation
- Fix auth cookies: Secure flag only on direct TLS or X-Forwarded-Proto: https (fixes form login on HTTP and behind reverse proxies); document requirement in deploy templates

- Fix time-tracking input fields: absorb a manually typed colon when the auto-colon is already present (prevents 19::0 double-separator); accept bare hour values (e.g. 20) as 20:00 on Enter in the start/end popup, standby form, and grid cell

- Add per-user audit trail: admin Edit User panel shows full login/activity history (login ok/fail, logout, password change/reset, MFA events, passkey and API key lifecycle, email change, admin-on-behalf actions); each entry records timestamp, IP, client, and actor; LoginHistory model gains ActorID/ActorUsername fields
- Fix RBAC: block customer-role users from UpdateInboxTicket and DeleteInboxTicket; fix ListContracts IDOR (now requires requireCustomerAccess); raise project API key create/delete from member to owner role
- Ansible collection v0.5.0: add epic, sprint, ticket_checklist_template modules; user module gains state=restore (un-soft-delete) and state=purge (permanent removal with FK cleanup)
- Show contract hourly rate in the weekly time log grid: display the base rate (e.g. "45 €/h") per row with a ✦ badge when time-slot overrides are present; contracts are eagerly loaded on week load
- Route all backend log output to syslog (LOG_DAEMON, tag "warmdesk") in addition to stderr so auth events and server messages are captured by standard log aggregation tools
- Change server startup message to "Starting WarmDesk - Time Tracking <version>" when running in --mode=timetracking
- Fix fill-from-slots: multi-day overnight slots (e.g. Fri 19:00→Mon 07:00 with end_day_offset=3) now store start_time="00:00"/end_time="00:00" on continuation days (Sat/Sun), showing the dot indicator and correct shift times in the popup instead of the 09:00–17:00 placeholder
- Seed standby entries for current week: warmdesk-seed --reset pre-fills Mon–Sun with Acme Phase 1 standby time entries (Mon–Fri 19:00→07:00, Sat/Sun 00:00–00:00) so the rate column and time-slot features are immediately visible
- Replace working-hours single start-time input with start+end time pair per day: three-column grid (Start / End / Hours) with calculated net hours displayed live; existing start-time values are preserved

- Add website release blog posts for v0.12.33 and v0.12.34
- Sync time macro libraries per user on the server; separate run popout (bottom bar) from editor (top bar); macro i18n in all languages; fix row-comment and double-click-edit translations
- Add website release blog post for v0.12.35
- Add system tray icon to the Tauri desktop app with unread-notification badge (cards, tickets, chat), show/hide window menu item, and quit item; add close-to-tray behavior and Settings → Interface toggles for both
- Add custom date range option to the time-tracking report period selector, opening a Start/End date picker instead of only week/month/year presets
- Show distance and undeclarable (unbillable) time per row in the time-tracking report and its PDF export, in addition to group/grand totals; add matching PDF export options
- Show the undeclarable/billable time breakdown for every report grouping, not only when grouped by customer

- Fix systemd unit ReadWritePaths to include the uploads directory alongside data
- Net credit notes into the invoice list's revenue summary totals instead of excluding them
- Add a per-user "require password change on next login" flag, settable from the admin New User and Edit User forms, enforced across password/passkey/MFA login and cleared automatically on next password change
- Add Generate/Copy password buttons to the admin New User and Edit User password fields
- Backfill 84 i18n keys missing from all 11 non-English locales and translate remaining untranslated English strings across every locale

- Add admin visibility and management for user passkeys: a registered-count badge and Revoke passkeys button in Edit User, backed by new GET/DELETE /admin/users/:id/passkeys endpoints
- Adopt real semver (PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR) versioning discipline starting at v0.13.0, replacing the flat incrementing counter used through v0.12.42
- Add an "Undeclarable" time basis option to the time-tracking report chart view, alongside the existing Declarable and Total options, in both the on-screen chart and the chart PDF export
- Add a Passkey column to the Admin Users table showing at a glance which users have a passkey registered; shorten "Last Password Change" to "Last PWD Change" to make room for it
- Clear the auth rate limit bucket for an IP after a fully successful login (password, passkey, MFA, or refresh) so earlier failed attempts no longer risk locking out a user who just authenticated correctly
- Fix passkey login errors being masked by a bogus token-refresh retry: the 401-retry interceptor now excludes /auth/passkey/login so the real failure reason is shown instead of a generic "missing refresh token" message
- Fix bar and stacked-bar chart hover offset when the app is zoomed in or out: chart canvases now cancel the app-wide CSS zoom locally so Chart.js's hover hit-testing always operates in a consistent, unzoomed coordinate space
- Fix time-tracking report pie chart cramped into a 420px square: 1.6:1 aspect ratio and a 640px-wide wrapper let the circle and legend fill the available space
- Fix admin Settings tab hard-capped narrower than every other admin tab: restructured into a responsive card grid that fills the full admin container width; also fixes paired fields (Postal Code+City, VAT+CoC number) stacking vertically instead of side-by-side in both admin Settings and the Customer edit modal
- Fix time-tracking report charts grouping near-duplicate activity descriptions (case, spacing, punctuation variants) as separate activities and inflating the "Other" slice: activities are now grouped by a normalized key, displaying whichever raw spelling has the most logged minutes
- Raise the time-tracking report chart category limit from 7 to 10 before falling into "Other"; added 3 new colorblind-safe colors per theme (light/dark/black), validated so adjacent chart slices stay distinguishable under protanopia/deuteranopia simulation
- Fix stale out-of-order responses when switching time-tracking weeks quickly: loadWeek() now guards with a request token so an older, slower response can no longer overwrite a newer one and leave rows visible with no matching time entries
- Fix a fresh time-tracking week silently inheriting the row layout from whatever week was last edited: loadTimeEntryRowOrderKeys no longer falls back to a global saved order when a specific week has none of its own, so a never-customized week starts with only its own actual entries
- Hardcode each release blog post's own version number instead of the shared {warmdesk-version} attribute, so historical posts stop silently displaying whatever the current release happens to be
- Fix the time-tracking row-order debounced autosave writing to the wrong week: it read the target week and comments reactively inside the setTimeout callback instead of snapshotting them when the save was scheduled, so switching weeks within the 600ms delay could corrupt another week's saved row layout; also reset _keyOrder/_serverOrder unconditionally on every week load instead of only when a saved order existed
- Fix a deleted time-tracking row reappearing after switching weeks: the debounced row-order save cancelled instead of flushed any save still pending for the week being left, so a delete's own save could be discarded before it reached the server; the save is now flushed when it targets a different week, and also flushed on unmount so leaving the page entirely can't strand it
- Fix the admin backup list showing no date (read a nonexistent field instead of the backend's actual last-modified timestamp), backup download always failing (passed the filename to the wrong place, so every request targeted a backup literally named "undefined"), and the restore button doing nothing (called a function that didn't exist)
- Fix stray empty rows still appearing in time tracking after switching weeks: a reactive watcher could fire mid-switch with the new week's identity but the old week's still-unrefreshed entries, scheduling a save that mis-tagged the old week's real rows onto the new week; _keyOrder/_serverOrder are now reset synchronously the instant the week changes, instead of only after the new week's fetch resolves
- Fix passkey login failing for essentially every modern synced passkey: the WebAuthn Backup Eligible/Backup State flags were never persisted at registration, so login always reconstructed the stored credential with them defaulted to false, mismatching what real passkeys report and failing the library's anti-cloning check; registration now records these flags, and existing passkeys self-heal automatically on their next successful login
- Bundle the upload directory (attachments, avatars, logos, branding) into every backup as a tar.gz alongside the database dump, instead of covering the database only; add a backup_include_uploads setting to opt out; keep old database-only backups listable/downloadable/restorable alongside the new format
- Add an admin "Import Backup" flow for uploading a backup file (.tar.gz/.db/.sql) downloaded from this or another WarmDesk server; right after import, ask whether to completely replace the current data or add the backup's data to what's already there (uploaded files always merge safely; SQLite database rows are inserted only when their ID doesn't already exist locally, never overwriting existing data)
- Fix the Windows desktop app blanking out for up to two minutes on startup: index.html's fetch proxy had no exclusion for Tauri's own internal ipc.localhost/asset.localhost requests, so every invoke() call was forced out through the native HTTP client instead of handled locally, triggering a slow real network resolution for a hostname never meant to leave the WebView
- Fix the passkey login button showing up again in the desktop app (Windows/Linux/macOS); passkey login is meant to be browser-only since platform authenticator support is too inconsistent across the WebViews the desktop app runs in
- Fix the Vite dev server crashing on Windows during desktop app development: it had no watch exclusion for src-tauri/target, so its file watcher tried to track Rust's build output and crashed on a file locked mid-write by cargo
- Switch the Windows desktop app to the native TLS stack (schannel) instead of bundled rustls, so server/proxy setups that expect mid-handshake TLS renegotiation (which rustls deliberately doesn't support) work correctly; Linux and macOS are unaffected
- Add a drag-and-drop calendar view to time tracking, toggled via a new button next to the macro editor: entries render as blocks positioned by start/end time, draggable to move between days/times and resizable to change duration, with a right-click menu and click-drag on empty slots to create new entries; grid density is zoomable and remembered per browser; add a "Log Time view" user setting to default the tab to table or calendar
- Add an optional color to customers (full CRM customers and time-tracking-only ones), editable from the customer forms and the manage-time-tracking-customers tab, used to color-code the calendar view; customers left without a color are automatically assigned one not already used by another customer
- Give every seeded demo customer a color and every seeded time entry a start/end time (previously only a duration), and make the seed program's entry-creation loops hand out sequential non-overlapping times per user/day so demo data renders sensibly in the calendar view
- Fix the time-tracking calendar's resize handles sending the entry's raw ISO timestamp instead of a plain date, which made every resize fail with a server error; also make the resize handles visible on hover instead of an invisible hit zone
- Fix hidden customers always rendering as generic gray blocks in the time-tracking calendar (and resolving with no name in the classic weekly table's row selector) because the customer list request behind both excluded hidden customers by default
- Add a "Calendar block color" user setting letting the time-tracking calendar color blocks by project instead of customer; projects without an explicit color are auto-assigned one using the same non-repeating palette logic already used for customers
- Fix image uploads (avatars, customer logos, company branding) rejecting SVG files unconditionally and rejecting valid PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP files whenever the browser sent no content-type header, by validating solely against the file's actual content; also honor the configured max upload size instead of a hardcoded 10 MB
- Fix replaced avatars and logos (user, customer, company, project, group) never deleting the file they replaced, leaving every past upload behind forever; the previous file is now removed whenever one of these is changed or cleared
- Add a gc-uploads backend CLI tool that finds upload files no longer referenced by any user, customer, project, group, system setting, or attachment, and lists them (dry run) or removes them with --delete, to reclaim files orphaned by the pre-fix avatar/logo replacement bug
- Fix the time-tracking calendar view leaving dead space below the grid instead of filling the panel, and fix the page footer scrolling along with it instead of staying pinned
- Fix overnight time entries (e.g. 19:00 to 07:00 the next day) rendering as a ~15-minute sliver instead of spanning to midnight; render them as two linked blocks split at midnight instead
- Fix dragging to resize an overnight time entry collapsing its duration down to 15 minutes, because the resize math assumed the end time always came after the start time on the same day
- Fix the time entry edit dialog rejecting any overnight time range (end time earlier than start time) outright, with an unrelated borrowed error message; overnight ranges are now accepted with a correct validation message
- Add an instance_mode config setting ("" production | "test") that serves orange, "TEST"-ribboned logo variants across the web UI and exported PDFs instead of the default green ones, so a test/staging instance is never mistaken for production; composes independently with the existing app_mode timetracking branding
- Add ready-made multi-instance deployment templates (deploy/multi-instance/) for running several WarmDesk instances behind a load balancer sharing one database, Redis, and upload volume
- Fix a chain of MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL compatibility bugs invisible against SQLite's lax defaults: startup validation for a parseTime-less MySQL DSN, auth handlers no longer masking real database errors as invalid-credentials, reserved-word quoting in raw SQL conditions (which also made the IP allowlist security check silently fail open), non-nullable card-history columns breaking every card creation, SQLite-only date functions in ticket queries, and settings saves failing to persist a re-saved identical value due to MySQL's rows-changed-vs-matched semantics
- Fix warmdesk-seed --reset always crashing against MySQL/MariaDB and silently leaving duplicate demo data behind across runs
- Fix a broad set of WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility gaps: a keyboard-unreachable dashboard card, several modals/popovers with no dialog semantics or focus-on-open, unlabeled ticket/admin form fields, unlabeled color inputs, decorative icons missing aria-hidden, a hover-only reaction tooltip with no keyboard equivalent, and incomplete ARIA wiring on custom tab/toggle groups; also fix a global route-change focus handler that could silently steal focus back from a dialog that opened on page load
- Remove dead code found by a deadcode/knip audit: superseded email-sending methods, a duplicated position-rebalancing helper, an already-shadowed PDF formatting function, a superseded WebSocket broadcast method, four unused frontend files, three one-off migration scripts, and two unnecessary npm dependencies
- Add orange test-instance branding (with a "(TEST)" title/tooltip) to the desktop app's system tray icon, matching the existing web UI and PDF branding
- Fix the desktop system tray icon never actually updating at all — badge counts, the timetracking-mode icon, and the title never changed — due to a tray lookup by an id that was never assigned to it, and (once fixed) a GTK call made off the main thread that hung indefinitely instead of erroring
- Fix same-date time-tracking entries appearing in an unpredictable order within period-grouped reports and customer/project groupings; order them by start time
- Fix the time-tracking report's Distance/Time columns not being right-aligned like the other numeric columns
- Redesign the time-tracking report's per-group and grand-total footers as single, clearly highlighted rows (Distance/Undeclarable/Time) instead of several stacked lines
- Fix card_labels missing its created_at column on every install — from an implicit many2many join table GORM auto-generates from Card.Labels/Label.Cards silently colliding with the richer explicit model the app actually uses to attach labels to cards, which broke that entirely; existing databases self-heal on next startup
- Fix a fresh PostgreSQL install being unable to start at all: the passkey table's PublicKey/AAGUID columns were pinned to SQLite's blob type, which doesn't exist in PostgreSQL
- Add a warmdesk-db-convert CLI (bundled in the release tarball) that copies every table between any combination of SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL — restores a downloaded backup file directly with --backup (auto-extracting, auto-detecting the source driver, copying bundled uploads), and reads the destination's db_driver/db_dsn/upload_dir straight from its own warmdesk.yaml with --dst-config so no credentials are needed on the command line
- Add ticket subjects and time-entry descriptions to global search, scoped the same way as the rest of search (project/customer/conversation membership, or everything for admins; time-entry visibility additionally widened for admins and time-tracking viewers, though editing one is still always owner-only)
- Add search & replace: find and replace text across cards, card comments, direct messages, tickets, and time entries, with a per-category selection, a permission-aware preview showing every match before anything changes, and re-checked permissions at apply time; chat messages are search-only since there's no edit capability for them
- Make clicking a card-comment or time-entry search result scroll to and briefly highlight the exact comment or calendar entry, instead of just opening the containing card or the general time-tracking page
- Patch known vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies: axios, dompurify, form-data, postcss, and undici
- Make search & replace's per-type result limit adjustable (default 20, up to 500) instead of a fixed 20 inherited from the quick-search dropdown; show a note under any category still capped at the limit shown
- Fix the time-tracking calendar's click/drag-to-create-entry landing on the wrong time on the Tauri Linux desktop app: getBoundingClientRect() on the scrolled day column went stale after scrolling, and clientY/getBoundingClientRect() could report a visual pixel space that's a constant multiple of the CSS pixel space the calendar's zoom is defined in, tied to the display's scale factor; click math now anchors to the scroll container's own stable position and calibrates the pixel ratio live against the hour labels
- Fix the time-tracking calendar's 00:00 label sitting right on the border between the day-header row and the grid instead of clear of it
- Fix the desktop tray icon's "Show WarmDesk" menu item hiding the window instead of bringing it to front when the window was already open but not focused
- Add customer locations: a customer can have multiple locations, each with a full address (line 1/2, city, postcode, region, country), phone number, contact person (name, email, phone), and a standard travel distance, managed from a new Locations tab in customer settings
- Add travel distance auto-fill to time tracking: pick one of a customer's locations from the weekly grid (add row, edit row, per-cell distance popup) or the calendar entry editor to auto-fill the standard travel distance, staying freely editable afterward; re-picking a row's location also corrects that week's already-logged distances, not just future entries
- Fix the time-tracking weekly grid silently wiping an entry's saved travel distance whenever its hours were edited or its row was renamed to a different customer/project (the renaming case also dropped the assigned contract), because the save requests omitted those fields instead of preserving them
- Add a deploy/update_warmdesk_client script that updates the Tauri desktop client to the latest GitHub release on Linux (.deb/.rpm/AppImage, auto-detected) and macOS (.app in /Applications), verifying the GPG detached signature when available
- Fix creating a project from the Admin Panel failing with "project name or slug already exists" starting with the second project, because the admin creation path never set the new project's key prefix, which has a unique index; the regular (non-admin) project creation flow was unaffected
- Fix the Admin Panel's Groups list and a group's Customer access table showing the literal text customer.title instead of a Customers column heading, because both referenced a nonexistent translation key
- Add Ryver support to the warmdesk-import/warmdesk-export migration tools: import tasks (columns, labels/tags, comments with their own attachments, assignees, creator, start/due dates), forum topics, and full project chat history, with a configurable user_map resolving external names to WarmDesk accounts (including real author attribution via short-lived per-user API keys) and include.cards/include.chat toggles to import either category independently; along the way, fixed Ryver's actual OData schema being lowercase-entity-named and category-based rather than tag-based for columns, several timestamp format mismatches, and an OData nested-expand truncation bug that silently dropped attachments beyond the first
- Fix card comments and topic replies never surfacing an attachment even though the upload endpoint accepted and stored one; card_comment attachments are now loaded and returned everywhere comments are, and rendered in the card detail view
- Fix a comment or chat message consisting only of an attachment (no text) being unable to be created at all, since the backend required a non-empty body
- Add paste-a-screenshot and file-attach support to the card comment compose box, matching the existing direct-message compose pattern
- Add a REST endpoint for creating project chat messages (previously only reachable via the live WebSocket connection), with an optional historical timestamp override for backfilled/imported messages
- Bring back a UI for project chat (a "Project Chat" entry on the Topics page) after its previous panel was removed as unused dead code in an earlier cleanup, leaving the feature fully functional at the API/database level but with no way to actually view or send a message
- Add support for multiple backup-notification email addresses (comma, semicolon, or whitespace separated) instead of a single address
- Patch a transitive brace-expansion vulnerability in frontend dev dependencies
- Fix project labels being creatable and deletable but not editable in the UI, even though the backend endpoint and API client already supported it; the Add Label modal now doubles as an edit modal with an Edit button on each label row
- Fix Ryver migration failing with a plain-HTML 400 for any team name containing a space (e.g. "Restic Server") because the name was spliced into the request URL unescaped, producing an invalid raw HTTP request line rejected by the reverse proxy in front of Ryver before it reached Ryver's own API; a name with a literal "&" would have failed worse by truncating the query string
- Fix Ryver chat-only imports failing with "$skip not supported", since Chat.History() rejects Ryver's usual $skip-based pagination outright unlike every other endpoint; chat history import now pages with an id-based cursor instead
- Fix re-importing chat only into an already-imported Ryver project failing with "card prefix is already used by another project", since the migration tool always created a brand-new project; it now reuses the existing project by slug when one is found
- Fix the dark-background company logo preview in Admin Settings not showing, since the preview swatch used a theme-dependent background color that was light in light mode, making the typically light/white dark-bg logo artwork invisible against it
- Add a sections visibility menu to the main sidebar (show/hide Favorite Projects, All Projects, Customers, Tickets, People, Chats, etc.) and to the Topics page sidebar (show/hide the Project Chat entry), both via a "⋮" menu, on top of the existing per-section collapse/expand
- Add TURN server support for 1:1 calls (turn_urls/turn_username/turn_credential config, a GET /api/v1/ice-servers endpoint the frontend fetches dynamically) since STUN-only can't relay media across symmetric NATs/CGNAT/restrictive firewalls, causing calls to connect but show a black screen with no audio/video on VPNs and some networks
- Fix 1:1 calls silently failing to connect, or only failing after clicking Accept several times: acceptCall() had no guard against being invoked twice, and an impatient second click during the multi-second getUserMedia() wait started a second, concurrent negotiation that corrupted shared peer-connection state; the Accept button now disables itself with a spinner while connecting, and negotiation failures show a real error and reset cleanly instead of hanging
- Add a browser tab title blink ("New message!") for unread DMs/project chat while the tab isn't focused, stopping as soon as it regains focus
- Fix the Admin Panel's edit-another-user's-profile endpoint only allowing English or Dutch as a locale, unlike the user's own self-service settings which already supported all 12 languages
- Fix the Linux desktop (AppImage) build shipping with no working camera/microphone device detection, since make appimage relied on a linuxdeploy plugin that doesn't reliably invoke and the built app had no GStreamer capture plugins at all; the build now bundles them directly from the build host and warns if the webrtcbin plugin specifically didn't make it in
- Add a per-user "Create projects" permission (Admin → Users), off by default for non-admins, since previously any non-viewer user could create a project; the "+ New Project" button is hidden for users without it
- Fix screen share only showing a cropped portion of the shared screen to the other party, since the remote video always used object-fit: cover (wrong for an arbitrary screen resolution, unlike a camera feed); a new call.screen_share signal tells the viewer when the incoming stream is a screen share so it can switch to object-fit: contain for that case only
- Add a muted-mic indicator next to the other party's name during a call, via a new call.mute signal sent when either side toggles mute, since WebRTC has no built-in way to convey this otherwise
- Make the in-call text chat sidebar resizable by dragging its left edge, same pattern as the main app sidebar, with its width persisted per browser
- Fix the browser tab blink for new messages never stopping even after the message was read, since the project-chat unread counter only ever incremented and was never cleared anywhere in the code; now cleared on opening the Project Chat panel and on window refocus if it was already open
- Fix creating a user with only First/Last name (no explicit display name) setting the display name to the user ID instead of "First Last", matching the fallback convention already used elsewhere (e.g. macro placeholders)
- Fix creating a user with an invalid email or other bad field just saying "invalid request" instead of the specific problem, e.g. "invalid email address" or "username must be at least 3 characters"
- Fix the emoji picker opening on a bare ':' before any search text was typed, which is disruptive since ':' is common in ordinary prose unlike '@' for mentions; now requires at least one character after the colon
- Fix the emoji picker silently eating typed text: it always stole focus into its own search box on open even when triggered by typing ':something' in a compose box, so further keystrokes landed in the hidden search field instead of the message; focus now only moves into the popup when opened with nothing pre-typed (the toolbar button case)
- Fix searching ASCII emoticons like ':-)' in the emoji picker returning "No results", since the search only matched emoji shortcode names/tags which have no emoticon aliases; it now also checks against the app's existing emoticon-to-emoji table
- Fix code blocks in direct-message chat being unreadable in dark theme, since the purple "own message" bubble's inline-code color rule leaked into fenced code blocks via CSS descendant matching, making plain non-highlighted text render white-on-white
- Fix numbers and some symbols in DM code blocks rendering with odd extra spacing between characters (e.g. "100644" as "1 0 0 6 4 4"), since the message bubble's font-variant-emoji: emoji (added so real emoji in chat text render full-color) was inherited into code blocks and forced digits/symbols into wide emoji-style glyph metrics
- Fix the sidebar's "⋮" section-visibility menu sitting visibly out of line with the first section's row, by widening the sidebar's default width and repositioning the menu onto the same row as the section title, to the right of its collapse chevron
- Add a pop-out floating window mode for both 1:1 WebRTC and LiveKit group calls, draggable and resizable (including via keyboard on the move/resize handles), with its position and size persisted, so a call no longer has to cover the whole browser window
- Fix the "New message!" tab-title blink giving no indication of which conversation or project chat triggered it, and focusing the tab only swapping it for an equally unexplained static "●"; it now names the DM sender, the project, or the unread count instead of a generic message
- Fix CI builds for the server and Linux client failing with "unable to cache dependencies"/npm ci errors, since a prior cleanup commit mistakenly untracked frontend/package-lock.json (grouped with an unrelated generated PNG) and added it to .gitignore
- Add avatar_url support to the admin user-creation endpoint, and make it clearable on update, matching how project avatars already worked; AdminUpdateUser's theme validator was also missing the "black" theme, so it couldn't be set for other users via the admin API
- Fix renaming a customer, or toggling its hidden status in Admin → Customers, silently wiping its color, billing address, VAT number, and PO reference, since the update endpoint applied every field from the request unconditionally even when the request didn't mention it; it now only touches fields actually sent
- Fix marking an invoice as sent, editing its line items, or recording a payment silently wiping its notes and due date, for the same underlying reason as the customer fix above
- Fix clicking "clear" on a ticket's reminder or close date showing a success message but not actually clearing it, since Go couldn't distinguish an explicit clear from the field simply being absent from the request; the endpoint now tells the two apart correctly
- Fix promoting a project member's role via the API returning a user object with empty username/email fields, since the lookup query was missing a Preload("User")
- Fix a freshly created webhook's API response missing its project_id field, contradicting the documented response shape
- Add avatar/color/billing-address fields to the Ansible collection's customer and group modules, sidebar_color to the news module, can_create_projects to user_access, is_spam to the ticket module, and hourly/per-km pricing plus time-slots to the contract module — all fields the API already supported but the modules didn't expose
- Fix several Ansible collection modules (contract pricing/time-slots, sprint dates, invoice-template line items, group description) silently blanking fields they weren't touching whenever they wrote anything else, by having them resend the current value for fields not explicitly changed
- Fix several Ansible collection card/checklist-item fields (story points, external issue link, epic, closed state, time spent, is_completed) being silently dropped when set at creation time, since the create endpoints don't accept them; the modules now apply them via an automatic follow-up update
- Fix the Ansible collection's column module failing outright when clearing an existing column's WIP limit (wip_limit=0), since the update endpoint rejects values below 1 unlike creation; it now uses the dedicated wip_limit_clear flag instead
- Fix the Ansible collection's column module breaking ansible-doc/ansible-lint for the entire collection, since a documentation note contained an unescaped "wip_limit: 0" that YAML parsed as an attempted mapping key
- Add a voice-only call button next to the camera button in 1:1 and group chat headers, using the same call infrastructure as video calls (has_video signaling, and the audio-only call bar that previously only appeared as a camera-failure fallback) so it can now be chosen deliberately
- Fix a group call that failed to connect throwing a "Cannot access 'activeConv' before initialization" console error, since a watch() closed over a variable declared later in the same function and Vue evaluates a watch's getter once synchronously at registration
- Fix the backup notification email's subject and body repeating "WarmDesk" twice (e.g. "WarmDesk — WarmDesk backup succeeded") when no company branding is configured, since the default company name is itself "WarmDesk"
- Fix `systemctl start warmdesk` reporting success even when the server was about to crash on startup (bad JWT secret, wildcard CORS, port already in use), since the unit used Type=simple and systemd considers the job done the instant the process forks; the server now binds its listener and signals readiness to systemd only after startup actually succeeds, and both warmdesk.service units switch to Type=notify to wait for it
- Fix the Calendar sub-view of Log Time having no bottom toolbar at all, since the add-row/macro/copy-previous-week/undo/export bar only ever existed inside the table sub-view; it's now shared between both sub-views, with the table-only "Add row" control hidden in calendar mode
- Add a Location picker to time macro rows (single-day and alternating A/B patterns), matching the weekly grid and calendar entry forms — picking a customer location auto-fills the row's travel distance, and the picked location is saved with the macro template
- Fix a time entry's picked location never actually being remembered — the weekly grid's distance popup, the calendar entry modal, and macro-applied entries only copied the location's travel distance into the distance field, so reopening the popup/modal always showed "Choose location" again; the location is now stored on the entry itself and can be changed independently of the distance value
- Fix card titles containing Markdown rendering as raw text (backticks, asterisks, etc. shown literally) on board card tiles and in the read-only title view for viewer-role users, unlike descriptions and comments which already rendered Markdown correctly
- Fix ordered/unordered lists in rendered Markdown having no left indent in card descriptions/comments, call chat, and topic posts/replies, since those views were missing the padding-left the app's global CSS reset strips from list elements (the `.markdown-body` class already had this, but several other views render Markdown without it)
- Add a name field to customer locations, shown as the label in time-tracking Location dropdowns (weekly grid, distance popup, macros, calendar modal), with address fallback when unset
- Add Copy/Paste to the time-tracking calendar's right-click menu: copy a block, then paste it into an empty slot to create a new entry with the same customer, project, activity, distance, and location
- Add read-only Ticket API endpoints (`GET /api/v1/ticket/{slug}/columns`, `/cards`, `/cards/{id}`) so an API key — including a project-scoped one — can list lanes and cards (filterable by column name or id, open cards only unless include_closed=true) or fetch a card with its comments without mutating anything
- Regenerate the Swagger spec, restoring the card comment list/create endpoints whose annotations were dropped in v0.9.0
- Add PATCH /api/v1/ticket/{slug}/cards/{id} for partial card updates via API key (title, description, priority, closed, start/due date, story points), with explicit null clearing nullable fields, strict validation that rejects unknown or invalid fields without applying anything, history entries under the key's user, and a live board update
- Accept a card key (e.g. ANSI-12) wherever the Ticket API takes a card id, and a lane name ("column") wherever it takes a column_id
- Accept priority, start/due date, and story points when creating a card through the Ticket API, and return the enriched card (key, column_name) from create and move
- Bring the website's user guide, admin guide, and API reference up to date, add release posts for v0.20–v0.29, and fix broken download and docs links in older blog posts
- Fix API key docs that still advertised the unsupported ?api_key= query parameter

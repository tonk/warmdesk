module: card
short_description: Manage cards on a WarmDesk Kanban board
version_added: "0.1.0"
author: "Ton Kersten (@tonk)"
description:
  - Creates, updates, moves, or deletes a card on a WarmDesk Kanban board.
  - Idempotent for I(state=present) — the module first tries to locate the card
    by I(card_number) (preferred) or by I(project) + I(column) + I(title).
    If a matching card is found its fields are compared and only a PUT is
    issued when something differs.
  - For I(state=absent) and updates, I(card_number) (e.g. C(EDA-42)) is the
    preferred lookup key; I(title) is used as a fallback only for I(present).
  - Optional I(move_to_column) — if the card exists in a different column a
    PATCH move request is issued automatically.
  - Optional I(move_to_project) — moves the card to another project (into
    I(move_to_column) there). The card keeps its comments, checklist,
    attachments and history, and gets a new number in the target project;
    its old reference keeps working. This is idempotent, as a card that already lives in
    I(move_to_project) is recognised by its old I(card_number).
  - Requires at least I(member) role on the project (or global admin).
options:
  project:
    description:
      - Slug of the WarmDesk project (e.g. C(my-project)).
    type: str
    required: true
  column:
    description:
      - Name of the target column (e.g. C(Backlog)).
      - Required when creating a card (I(state=present) and no existing card
        is found by I(card_number)).
      - Also used as the idempotency key when I(card_number) is not given.
    type: str
    required: false
  title:
    description:
      - Card title. Required for all operations.
      - Used as part of the idempotency key (with I(project) and I(column))
        when I(card_number) is not supplied.

    type: str
    required: false
  assignee:
    description:
      - Username or email address of the user to assign to the card.
      - The module resolves the value to a numeric user ID.  It first
        queries C(GET /api/v1/users); if that returns 403 (project-scoped
        API key) it falls back to C(GET /api/v1/projects/{slug}/members),
        which is always accessible to project-scoped keys.
    type: str
    required: false
  card_number:
    description:
      - Existing card reference (e.g. C(EDA-42)).
      - When provided this is used as the primary lookup key, bypassing the
        title-based search.
    type: str
    required: false
  closed:
    description:
      - Whether the card is closed (done).
      - C(true) closes the card and sets C(closed_at); C(false) reopens it.
      - Omit the parameter to leave the closed state unchanged.
    type: bool
    required: false
  time_spent:
    description:
      - Total time logged against the card, in minutes (denormalized).
      - This directly sets the card-level counter, bypassing the
        comment-based auto-creation path.  Set to C(0) to clear it.
    type: int
    required: false
  story_points:
    description:
      - Story points for Scrum-board projects.
      - Not accepted by the create endpoint — when set together with card
        creation, this module applies it with an immediate follow-up update.
    type: int
    required: false
  external_issue_url:
    description:
      - URL of a linked external issue (e.g. a Jira or GitHub issue).
      - Pass an empty string to clear a previously set link.
      - Not accepted by the create endpoint — when set together with card
        creation, this module applies it with an immediate follow-up update.
    type: str
    required: false
  external_issue_ref:
    description:
      - Human-readable reference of a linked external issue (e.g. C(PROJ-123)).
      - Pass an empty string to clear a previously set reference.
      - Not accepted by the create endpoint — when set together with card
        creation, this module applies it with an immediate follow-up update.
    type: str
    required: false
  epic_id:
    description:
      - Numeric ID of the epic to link this card to, as a string (e.g.
        C("7")), or the literal string C(null) to clear it.
      - Not accepted by the create endpoint — when set together with card
        creation, this module applies it with an immediate follow-up update.
    type: str
    required: false
  move_to_column:
    description:
      - Name of the column the card should be moved to.
      - When set and the card is found in a different column, a PATCH move
        request is issued. Has no effect when the card is already in the
        target column.
    type: str
    required: false
  move_to_project:
    description:
      - Slug of another project to move the card to.
      - Requires I(card_number) and I(move_to_column) (a column name in the
        target project).
      - The server matches labels by name (creating missing ones), clears the
        epic and sprint, and removes assignees and watchers without access to
        the target project. I(epic_id) and I(assignee) therefore refer to the
        target project once the card has moved.
      - Needs a personal API key (or username/password); project-scoped keys
        are limited to one project and cannot move cards out of it.
    type: str
    required: false
    version_added: "0.7.0"
  sub_cards:
    description:
      - What happens to the card's sub-cards when I(move_to_project) moves it.
      - C(move) — sub-cards move along (into the target column with the same
        name as their current column, else I(move_to_column)).
      - C(detach) — sub-cards stay in the source project without a parent.
    type: str
    choices: [move, detach]
    default: move
    version_added: "0.7.0"
  state:
    description:
      - C(present) — ensure the card exists and its fields match.
      - C(absent) — ensure the card does not exist; requires I(card_number)
        or a unique I(title) match.
    type: str
    choices: [present, absent]
    default: present
extends_documentation_fragment:
  - ansilabnl.warmdesk.connection
notes:
  - Check mode is fully supported; no API writes are issued.
  - Date fields accept C(null) as a string to explicitly clear the date on an
    existing card.
  - The move operation (PATCH) is performed I(after) any field update (PUT),
    so both may fire in a single module run. The same holds for
    I(move_to_project), where fields are updated in the source project first, then
    the card is transferred.
  - C(description) cannot be cleared to empty through this API — the server
    treats an empty value the same as "not supplied" and leaves the stored
    description untouched. This module's idempotency check does the same, so
    it won't report C(changed) forever trying to apply a clear that can never
    take effect.
  - C(story_points), C(external_issue_url), C(external_issue_ref), and
    C(epic_id) are not accepted by the create endpoint. When any of them are
    set on a newly created card, this module issues an immediate follow-up
    update so the field still ends up applied — at the cost of one extra
    request on the creating run only.
  - Looking up a card by I(card_number) cannot find a sub-card. The project
    endpoint this module reads only returns top-level cards (those with no
    parent card), so a sub-card's reference is never present in that list to
    scan — this module has no way to locate one, whether by number or by
    title. Operate on the parent card, or use I(card_number) for a top-level
    card only.

## 1. Installation

For full build-from-source and quick-start instructions see
[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md). This guide assumes the binary is already running
and focuses on configuration and operations.

### Requirements at runtime

| Component | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| OS | Linux, macOS, or Windows |
| CPU | 1 core |
| RAM | 128 MB (SQLite) / 256 MB (PostgreSQL / MySQL) |
| Disk | 50 MB for the binary + your database and uploaded files |
| Network | Outbound SMTP (optional); inbound HTTP on your chosen port |

No external runtime dependencies — Go produces a single statically-linked
binary (except for SQLite, which requires `glibc` / `musl`).

---

## 2. Configuration Reference

Configuration is loaded in priority order (highest wins):

1. CLI flag `--config /path/to/file.yaml`
2. Environment variable `CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/file.yaml`
3. `warmdesk.yaml` in the current working directory
4. Built-in defaults

Every YAML key has a matching environment variable. Environment variables
always override the YAML file.

### Full configuration reference

```yaml
# ── Server ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
port: 8080                        # PORT — HTTP listen port
allowed_origins: "https://app.example.com"  # ALLOWED_ORIGINS — CORS origins

# ── Security ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
jwt_secret: "change-me-in-production"  # JWT_SECRET — HS256 signing key
                                        # Generate: openssl rand -hex 32

# ── Web assets ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
web_dir: "./web"                  # WEB_DIR — compiled frontend (required in prod)

# ── Database ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
db_driver: "sqlite"               # DB_DRIVER — sqlite | postgres | mysql
db_dsn: "./warmdesk.db"           # DB_DSN — file path or connection string
db_log: "warn"                    # DB_LOG — silent | error | warn | info

# ── File uploads ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
upload_dir: "./uploads"           # UPLOAD_DIR — where attachments are stored
max_upload_mb: 25                 # MAX_UPLOAD_MB — per-file upload limit

# ── Logging ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
gin_mode: "release"               # GIN_MODE — debug | release
api_log: false                    # API_LOG — log every HTTP request

# ── Redis (optional — for horizontal scaling) ──────────────────────────────────
redis_url: ""                     # REDIS_URL — e.g. redis://localhost:6379
                                  # Leave empty to use in-process pub/sub

# ── Locale defaults (overridden per user) ─────────────────────────────────────
default_locale: "en"              # DEFAULT_LOCALE — en | nl | de | fr | es
```

### Generating a strong JWT secret

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
# or
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Never use the built-in default `change-me-in-production` in any environment
that is accessible from a network.

---

## 3. Database Setup

### SQLite (default — recommended for single-server installs)

No setup needed. WarmDesk creates the file automatically.

```yaml
db_driver: sqlite
db_dsn: /var/lib/warmdesk/warmdesk.db
```

Ensure the directory is writable by the process user and is on a volume that is
included in your backup.

### PostgreSQL

```bash
# Create database and user
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER warmdesk WITH PASSWORD 'secret';"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE warmdesk OWNER warmdesk;"
```

```yaml
db_driver: postgres
db_dsn: "host=localhost user=warmdesk password=secret dbname=warmdesk port=5432 sslmode=require"
```

### MySQL / MariaDB

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE warmdesk CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE USER 'warmdesk'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';"
mysql -u root -p -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON warmdesk.* TO 'warmdesk'@'localhost';"
```

```yaml
db_driver: mysql
db_dsn: "warmdesk:secret@tcp(localhost:3306)/warmdesk?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"
```

### Schema migration

WarmDesk runs **GORM AutoMigrate** on every startup. New columns and tables are
created automatically; existing data is never destroyed. There are no separate
migration files to run.

---

## 4. Running as a Service

### systemd (Linux — recommended)

A ready-made unit file is at `deploy/warmdesk.service`. Edit it before
installing — at minimum set `JWT_SECRET` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

```ini
[Service]
Environment="JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here"
Environment="ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://warmdesk.example.com"
Environment="DB_DSN=/var/lib/warmdesk/warmdesk.db"
```

```bash
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false -d /opt/warmdesk warmdesk
sudo mkdir -p /opt/warmdesk/{data,uploads}
sudo cp -r dist/. /opt/warmdesk/
sudo chown -R warmdesk:warmdesk /opt/warmdesk

sudo cp deploy/warmdesk.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now warmdesk
sudo journalctl -u warmdesk -f   # follow logs
```

---

## 5. Reverse Proxy

Always run WarmDesk behind a reverse proxy in production. Ready-made configs
are in `deploy/`.

### Nginx (`deploy/nginx.conf`)

Key configuration points:

```nginx
# Increase timeouts for WebSocket connections
proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
proxy_send_timeout 3600s;

# WebSocket upgrade
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

# Forward real IP
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
```

```bash
sudo cp deploy/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/warmdesk
# Edit: replace yourdomain.com and SSL certificate paths
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/warmdesk /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Apache (`deploy/apache.conf`)

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel ssl headers rewrite
sudo cp deploy/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/warmdesk.conf
# Edit: replace yourdomain.com and SSL certificate paths
sudo a2ensite warmdesk
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

### CORS

Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the **exact** origin that users access WarmDesk from
(including scheme and port). A mismatch will prevent the frontend from making
API calls.

```bash
# Single domain
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://warmdesk.example.com

# Multiple domains (comma-separated)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://warmdesk.example.com,https://warmdesk.internal
```

Use `*` only in development — never in production.

---

## 6. First Admin Account

Register normally through the web interface. Then promote the account to admin:

**SQLite**
```bash
sqlite3 /var/lib/warmdesk/warmdesk.db \
  "UPDATE users SET global_role='admin' WHERE username='yourname';"
```

**PostgreSQL / MySQL**
```sql
UPDATE users SET global_role = 'admin' WHERE username = 'yourname';
```

Once one admin exists, you can promote further users through
**Admin → Users → Edit** in the web interface without touching the database.

If public registration is not desired, disable it after creating the first
admin: **Admin → Settings → Allow public registration → Off**.

---

## 7. Admin Panel

Access the admin panel via the **Admin** link in the navigation (visible to
admin users only).

### Users

| Action | Where |
|--------|-------|
| Create a user | Admin → Users → Create User |
| Edit name, email, role | Admin → Users → (click user) |
| Reset a password | Admin → Users → Edit → Change Password |
| Disable / enable | Admin → Users → Edit → Enabled toggle |
| Assign to projects | Admin → Users → (click user) → Projects tab |
| Delete a user | Admin → Users → Edit → Delete (permanent) |

**Global roles**

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| `user` | Can use the application; sees only their own projects |
| `admin` | Full access to all projects, all admin panel features |
| `viewer` | Read-only access; cannot create or modify anything |

### Projects

Admins can create, rename, archive, and delete any project regardless of
project membership. Access via **Admin → Projects**.

### System settings

All settings under **Admin → Settings** take effect **immediately without a
server restart**. They are stored in the database and loaded at request time.

---

## 8. SMTP Email

Email is used for:
- @mention notifications when the mentioned user is offline
- (Future: password reset)

### Configuring SMTP

Go to **Admin → Settings → Email** and fill in:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| SMTP Host | Hostname of your mail server, e.g. `smtp.gmail.com` |
| SMTP Port | Typically `587` (STARTTLS), `465` (TLS), or `25` (relay) |
| Username | Often your email address; leave empty for relay servers |
| Password | Leave empty for relay servers that don't require auth |
| From address | The `From:` header, e.g. `warmdesk@example.com` |
| From name | Display name, e.g. `WarmDesk` |

Click **Save** and then use **Send Test Email** to verify the configuration
before going live. Enter any email address in the test field and click **Send
Test** — a test message is delivered immediately.

### Gmail example

```
Host:     smtp.gmail.com
Port:     587
Username: youraddress@gmail.com
Password: (App Password — not your Google account password)
From:     youraddress@gmail.com
```

You must enable 2-factor authentication on the Google account and generate an
**App Password** for WarmDesk. Standard account passwords will not work.

### Auth-less relay (common in corporate environments)

Leave Username and Password empty. The mail server must be configured to accept
connections from the WarmDesk server's IP without authentication.

---

## 9. Company Branding

Go to **Admin → Settings → Branding** to set:

| Setting | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Company name | Appears in the report header |
| Company logo | URL or uploaded image; displayed on time reports |

Changes take effect immediately and appear on the next report export.

---

## 10. System Settings

### Session timeout

**Admin → Settings → Session → Idle Timeout (minutes)**

Default is `60` minutes. Set to `0` to disable the timeout entirely (sessions
last until the refresh token expires — 7 days). Fractional values are not
supported; enter a whole number of minutes.

The timer resets on any user interaction (navigation, clicks, API calls). When
the timeout expires the user is redirected to the login page.

### Default initial columns

**Admin → Settings → New Project Defaults → Initial Columns**

Enter one column name per line. These columns are created automatically whenever
a new project is made. The built-in default is:

```
Backlog
In Progress
Test & Review
To Production
```

### Default initial labels

**Admin → Settings → New Project Defaults → Initial Labels**

Enter one label name per line. These labels are created automatically for every
new project. The built-in default is:

```
Bug
Feature
Design
Content
```

> **Note:** Changes to Initial Columns and Initial Labels only affect
> **new** projects created after saving. Existing projects are not modified.
>
> Click the **Save** button that appears below the textareas to persist your
> changes before switching to another settings tab.

### Public registration

**Admin → Settings → Allow public registration**

When off, the Register link disappears from the login page. Users can only be
created by administrators via the admin panel.

### Global defaults (overridden per user)

Admins set global defaults for:
- Date / time format
- Timezone
- Theme (light / dark / system)
- Language
- Font and font size

Individual users can override any of these in their own User Settings.

---

## 11. Horizontal Scaling

WarmDesk uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates. In a single-instance
setup, connections are managed in memory. When running multiple instances behind
a load balancer, each instance has its own connection pool — a message broadcast
by one instance is not seen by clients connected to another.

### Redis pub/sub

Enable Redis to route broadcasts across all instances:

```yaml
redis_url: redis://localhost:6379
```

or

```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://username:password@redis-host:6379/0
```

When `redis_url` is set, WarmDesk subscribes to a Redis channel and all
`BroadcastToProject` calls publish to that channel. Every instance receives the
message and delivers it to its own connected clients.

### Load balancer requirements

WebSocket connections require **sticky sessions** (a.k.a. session affinity) at
the load balancer. Without sticky sessions a client's HTTP upgrade request and
subsequent WebSocket frames may reach different instances and fail.

With Redis enabled, sticky sessions are not strictly required for correctness,
but they reduce Redis traffic.

### Redis configuration

WarmDesk uses a single pub/sub channel per subscription scope. A minimal Redis
install with default settings works. No persistence (AOF/RDB) is required for
the pub/sub use case.

```bash
# Test connectivity
redis-cli -h redis-host ping
```

---

## 12. Desktop Apps

WarmDesk ships Tauri-based desktop apps that wrap the web frontend and connect
to a WarmDesk server. The apps are standalone — they do not bundle the server.

Users configure the server URL in the app's **Connect** screen on first launch.

### Distributing desktop apps

Pre-built desktop apps are attached to each GitHub release:

| Platform | File | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Linux | `WarmDesk-vX.Y.Z-x86_64.AppImage` | Portable; no installation required |
| Windows | `WarmDesk-vX.Y.Z-x64-setup.exe` | NSIS installer |
| Windows | `WarmDesk-vX.Y.Z-x64-portable.zip` | Extract and run `WarmDesk.exe` |
| macOS | `WarmDesk-vX.Y.Z-universal.dmg` | Universal binary (Intel + Apple Silicon) |

### Building desktop apps from source

See [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) — the `make appimage`, `make dmg`, and
`make windows-installer` targets.

---

## 13. Updates

```bash
# Pull latest source
git pull

# Rebuild
make build

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart warmdesk
```

AutoMigrate runs on startup and applies any schema changes automatically. No
manual migration step is needed.

### Zero-downtime update (advanced)

1. Build the new binary on a staging machine.
2. Copy the binary and `web/` directory to the server.
3. Send `SIGTERM` to the running process (systemd restart handles this).
4. The process finishes in-flight requests before exiting.

---

## 14. Backup and Recovery

### What to back up

| Item | Location | Frequency |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Database | `warmdesk.db` (SQLite) or PostgreSQL/MySQL dump | Daily or more |
| Uploads | `upload_dir` (default `./uploads/`) | Daily or more |
| Config | `warmdesk.yaml` | On change |

### SQLite backup

```bash
# Hot copy — safe while the server is running
sqlite3 /var/lib/warmdesk/warmdesk.db ".backup /backup/warmdesk-$(date +%Y%m%d).db"

# Or stop the service first and copy directly
sudo systemctl stop warmdesk
cp /var/lib/warmdesk/warmdesk.db /backup/warmdesk-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
sudo systemctl start warmdesk
```

### PostgreSQL backup

```bash
pg_dump -U warmdesk warmdesk | gzip > /backup/warmdesk-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz
```

### Restoring

```bash
# SQLite
cp /backup/warmdesk-20260329.db /var/lib/warmdesk/warmdesk.db

# PostgreSQL
gunzip -c /backup/warmdesk-20260329.sql.gz | psql -U warmdesk warmdesk
```

---

## 15. Demo Data

The `warmdesk-seed` binary ships alongside `warmdesk` and populates the
database with realistic demo content for evaluation and testing.

```bash
cd dist
./warmdesk-seed           # seed (idempotent — safe to run multiple times)
./warmdesk-seed --reset   # wipe all demo data and re-seed
```

**Demo accounts** (password for all: `demo1234`)

| Username | Display name | Role | Notes |
|----------|--------------|------|-------|
| `tonk` | Ton Kersten | admin | Persistent — not removed by `--reset` |
| `demo.admin` | Alex Admin | admin | |
| `demo.sarah` | Sarah Chen | user | Project admin: Website Redesign |
| `demo.marc` | Marc Dubois | user | Project admin: Mobile App v2 |
| `demo.lisa` | Lisa Park | user | Project admin: DevOps & Infra |
| `demo.priya` | Priya Nair | user | |
| `demo.james` | James O'Brien | user | |
| `demo.elena` | Elena Kovač | user | |
| `demo.raj` | Raj Sharma | user | |
| `demo.viewer` | Victor Viewer | viewer | Read-only demo account |

**Demo content**

- 3 projects: Website Redesign, Mobile App v2, DevOps & Infra
- Multiple columns per project with realistic cards
- Checklists, labels, priorities, due dates, and time entries on cards
- Threaded topics per project
- 4 direct message conversations and 1 group chat with realistic history

## 16. Security Checklist

Before exposing WarmDesk to the internet:

- [ ] Changed `JWT_SECRET` to a randomly generated 32-byte hex string
- [ ] Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the exact production domain
- [ ] Running behind HTTPS (TLS termination at the reverse proxy)
- [ ] `GIN_MODE=release` (suppresses debug output)
- [ ] `API_LOG=false` (or piped to a log file, not stdout)
- [ ] Database credentials are strong and not the defaults
- [ ] Uploads directory (`upload_dir`) is outside the web root
- [ ] Firewall allows inbound traffic on port 80/443 only; WarmDesk's port
      (8080) is not directly exposed
- [ ] Systemd service runs as a non-root dedicated user (`warmdesk`)
- [ ] Backup schedule is in place for the database and uploads
- [ ] Public registration disabled (`Allow public registration = off`) if only
      known users should access the instance
- [ ] SMTP credentials (if used) are an app-specific password, not a primary
      account password

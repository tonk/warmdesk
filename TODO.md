- Bugfix:
  On Fedora 43 this setting must be done to not show the blank screen:
  LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libwayland-client.so
  Client was built on Ubuntu 24.04. Could be that this library is
  LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libwayland-client.so
  Fix this, once and for all
- Change projects to add an extra layer
  so that we can have "Customer / Projects"

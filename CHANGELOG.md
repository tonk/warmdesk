# Changelog

All notable changes to WarmDesk are documented here.

## v0.4.6 — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Desktop app CLI flags** — `--version` / `-V` prints the app version and exits; `--maximized` starts the window maximised
- **Database TLS** — PostgreSQL and MySQL connections can now be encrypted via `db_tls_mode` (`disable` / `require` / `verify-ca` / `verify-full`), `db_tls_ca_cert`, `db_tls_cert`, `db_tls_key`; matching `DB_TLS_*` env vars; mutual TLS (client certificate) supported
- **Server TLS** — WarmDesk can now serve HTTPS directly without a reverse proxy; set `tls_cert` and `tls_key` (or `TLS_CERT` / `TLS_KEY` env vars) to enable; falls back to plain HTTP when either is absent

### Fixed
- **Linux desktop app network error** — webkit2gtk 4.1 treats `tauri://localhost` as a secure context and blocks `http://` requests as mixed content (same restriction as Windows WebView2); the fetch proxy now routes all HTTP/HTTPS requests through `tauri-plugin-http` on all Tauri platforms, while non-HTTP requests (internal `tauri://` scheme loads) continue to use native WebKit fetch — this also resolves the previously-reported blank screen caused by routing all requests through the plugin
- **Desktop app icons contained old Coworker branding** — all icon files (`32x32.png`, `128x128.png`, `128x128@2x.png`, `icon.png`, `icon.ico`, `icon.icns`) regenerated from the current WarmDesk SVG logo

### Changed
- **Desktop app version stamping** — `Cargo.toml` is now stamped with the git tag version alongside `tauri.conf.json`; `make appimage` / `make dmg` / `make windows-installer` stamp both files automatically before building so local builds report the correct version
- **AppImage build dependencies documented** — `INSTALL.md` gains a desktop app prerequisites section listing the required system libraries for Fedora/RHEL and Ubuntu/Debian, plus Rust installation instructions

## v0.4.5 — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Database TLS** — PostgreSQL and MySQL connections can now be encrypted and verified via four new settings (`db_tls_mode`, `db_tls_ca_cert`, `db_tls_cert`, `db_tls_key`) with matching `DB_TLS_*` environment variables; modes: `disable` (default), `require` (encrypt without cert verification), `verify-ca`, `verify-full`; mutual TLS (client certificate) is also supported
- **Server URL change from login page (desktop app)** — the current server URL is shown at the bottom of the login screen with a "Change" link that navigates back to the Connect screen; no need to reinstall or clear local storage to point the app at a different server
- **Version number on Connect screen** — the app version is now shown on the Connect screen in addition to the login page
- **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` wildcard support** — setting `allowed_origins` to `*` now correctly allows requests from any origin; previously `*` was treated as a literal string and had no effect

### Fixed
- **Windows desktop app login 403** — a combination of root causes all resolved: `http://tauri.localhost` (the actual Windows Tauri origin) was missing from the hard-coded CORS allow-list (only `https://tauri.localhost` was listed); HTTP/2 negotiation with `tauri-plugin-http` was rejected by some servers; some reverse proxies blocked the non-browser `reqwest` User-Agent on POST endpoints; error messages returned as a plain string body were not parsed correctly and showed as a generic failure
- **Desktop app fetch patch applied too early** — `window.fetch` is now patched via a synchronous inline script in `index.html` before any ES module loads, preventing a race condition where the first API request fired before the patch was in place

### Changed
- **CI: manual desktop build workflows** — split into per-platform jobs (Linux AppImage, macOS DMG, Windows installer); a manual server build workflow added; PowerShell-based version stamping replaced with a Node.js script that works on all platforms

## v0.4.4 — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Linux desktop app blank screen (regression in v0.4.3)** — the `tauri-plugin-http` fetch patch was applied on all platforms; on Linux (WebKitGTK, `tauri://` origin) this caused a blank screen on startup; the patch is now scoped to Windows only where the mixed-content restriction actually applies
- **Windows desktop app still could not connect (v0.4.3 partial fix)** — the plugin import was fire-and-forget; Vue mounted and fired the first API request before `window.fetch` was patched; the app now awaits the import before mounting so Axios sees the patched fetch from the very first request

## v0.4.3 — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Windows desktop app cannot connect to server** — the `@tauri-apps/plugin-http` JavaScript package was missing; the Rust crate was present but without the JS counterpart `window.fetch` was never patched, so WebView2 made all HTTP requests itself and blocked them as mixed content (`https://tauri.localhost` → `http://server`); installing the package and importing it at startup routes every request through the native Rust HTTP client
- **Axios requests in desktop app bypassed `tauri-plugin-http`** — Axios defaults to `XMLHttpRequest`, which is not intercepted by the plugin; the desktop app now uses the `fetch` adapter so Axios requests also go through the native HTTP client
- **GitHub Actions Go module cache failing** — `setup-go` was searching for `go.sum` in the repo root; path corrected to `backend/go.sum`

### Changed
- **GitHub Actions now runs on Node.js 24** — opted in via `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` ahead of the June 2026 forced migration

## v0.4.2 — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Resizable sidebar** — drag the inner edge of the sidebar to set your preferred width (150px–480px); works whether the sidebar is positioned left or right; width is persisted across sessions
- **App zoom** — `Ctrl +` / `Ctrl -` zoom the entire interface in or out in 10% steps (50%–200%); `Ctrl 0` resets to 100%; zoom level is persisted across sessions

## v0.4.1 — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **`logo-full.svg` not served in production** — the backend SPA catch-all was returning `index.html` for any path not explicitly registered; `logo-full.svg` is now registered as a static route in the router alongside `logo.svg`

### Changed
- **Migration tool config** — YAML section key renamed from `coworker:` to `warmdesk:`, environment variable overrides renamed from `COWORKER_URL` / `COWORKER_USERNAME` / `COWORKER_PASSWORD` / `COWORKER_PROJECT` to `WARMDESK_URL` / `WARMDESK_USERNAME` / `WARMDESK_PASSWORD` / `WARMDESK_PROJECT`, and the default config filename changed from `coworker-migrate.yaml` to `warmdesk-migrate.yaml`; Go type `CoworkerConfig` renamed to `WarmDeskConfig`; internal priority-map variable names updated to match
- **Header logo** — the app header now uses the full WarmDesk logo (`logo-full.svg`) instead of the icon-only mark
- **Documentation** — admin guide gains a Migration Tools section (§16) covering `warmdesk-export` / `warmdesk-import` usage, config, env vars, and column mapping; user guide corrects the header description and replaces the outdated EasyMDE editor reference with the plain-textarea reality; API reference fixes the API key format example; INSTALL.md lists all four distribution binaries
- **`.gitignore`** — `.claude/` directory excluded from version control

## v0.4.0 — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **`warmdesk-export`** — standalone binary that reads a WarmDesk project (columns, cards, checklists, comments, labels, tags, time entries, attachments, topics and replies) and pushes it to Jira, Trello, OpenProject, or Ryver
- **`warmdesk-import`** — standalone binary that reads a project from Jira, Trello, OpenProject, or Ryver and creates it in WarmDesk
- **`warmdesk-migrate.yaml.example`** — documented config file covering all four platforms; credentials can be supplied via the file, environment variables, or interactive prompts
- **Column mapping** — `column_map` in the config translates WarmDesk column names to/from platform-specific status/list names; unmapped columns are passed through unchanged
- Both migration binaries are built by `make build` and included in the distribution archive alongside `warmdesk-seed`

### Changed
- **Product renamed to WarmDesk** — all binaries, config files, documentation, and the application UI now use the WarmDesk name and logo; Go module path updated to `github.com/tonk/warmdesk`
- Config example file renamed from `coworker.yaml.example` to `warmdesk.yaml.example`
- Default database file is now `warmdesk.db`
- Distribution archive is now `warmdesk-{version}.tar.gz`
- Service template renamed to `deploy/warmdesk.service`

## v0.3.3 — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **`warmdesk-export`** — standalone binary that reads a WarmDesk project (columns, cards, checklists, comments, labels, tags, time entries, attachments, topics and replies) and pushes it to Jira, Trello, OpenProject, or Ryver; supports `--config FILE` and `--dry-run`
- **`warmdesk-import`** — standalone binary that reads a project from Jira, Trello, OpenProject, or Ryver and creates it in WarmDesk; same flags and config format
- **`warmdesk-migrate.yaml.example`** — documented config file covering all four platforms; credentials can be supplied via the file, environment variables (`WARMDESK_URL`, `WARMDESK_USERNAME`, `WARMDESK_PASSWORD`, `WARMDESK_PROJECT`, `PLATFORM_API_TOKEN`, `PLATFORM_API_KEY`), or interactive prompts
- **Column mapping** — `column_map` in the config translates WarmDesk column names to/from platform-specific status/list names; unmapped columns are passed through unchanged
- Both binaries are built by `make build` and included in the distribution archive alongside `warmdesk-seed`

### Platform notes
- **Jira**: issues created via REST API v3; descriptions and comments in Atlassian Document Format; checklist items as Subtasks; time via worklogs; column mapped via workflow transitions
- **Trello**: lists created on the board as needed; checklists native; time posted as a comment; labels created per card
- **OpenProject**: work packages via API v3 HAL+JSON; checklist items as child work packages; time entries posted; status/priority/type resolved by name at export time
- **Ryver**: tasks posted to a team workroom via the OData API; columns encoded as tags; topics exported as forum posts; falls back to topic post if the task API is unavailable

## v0.3.2 — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Desktop app cannot connect to server** — `tauri-plugin-http` was never installed, so `globalThis.fetch` fell back to the native WebView browser fetch which is subject to CORS; on Windows the Tauri app origin (`https://tauri.localhost`) was not in the server's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, blocking every API call and the ConnectView probe; added `tauri-plugin-http` which patches `globalThis.fetch` with a native HTTP client that bypasses CORS entirely
- **Blank screen on Linux desktop app** — WebKitGTK's DMA-BUF renderer silently fails on many GPU configurations (Intel/AMD integrated, NVIDIA with certain drivers, VMs, some Wayland compositors), leaving the window completely blank; `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` is now set automatically on Linux before the Tauri runtime starts to force the reliable compositing fallback; users can override by setting the variable themselves before launching

### Changed
- **CI: Node.js upgraded to 24** in the GitHub Actions release workflow (Node 20 actions were deprecated)

## v0.3.1 — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Code blocks unreadable in dark mode** — inline code had a hard-coded `background: #f1f5f9` (the same near-white as dark-mode text), making code invisible; background is now `var(--color-border)` with an explicit `color: var(--color-text)`; fenced code blocks (`pre`) now use `var(--color-bg)` / `var(--color-text)` with a border; `pre code` resets the background to transparent so the outer block colour wins

## v0.3.0 — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Close / reopen cards** — a Close Card button in the card detail footer marks a card as closed; closed cards appear on the board with a strikethrough title and reduced opacity and can be reopened at any time; closed cards are included in time reports with a "Closed" badge and strikethrough in the title column
- **Closed cards in time reports** — the report response now carries a `closed` flag per card; closed cards are visually distinguished in the report table (strikethrough + red "Closed" badge) without being excluded from totals
- **Copy card** — a "Copy Card" button in the card detail footer duplicates the card (title, description, priority, due date, labels, tags) in the same column; the copy is appended below the original with "(copy)" appended to the title; board updates in real time for all connected users
- **Transfer card** — a "Transfer…" panel in the card detail lets you copy or move a card to any project you have access to; choose a destination project and column, then click "Copy Here" or "Move Here"; labels and assignees are intentionally not copied (they are project-specific); the originating project board updates instantly when a card is moved away
- **Open card count in Admin → Projects** — the projects table now shows an "Open Cards" column with the number of non-closed cards per project
- **Open card count on project tiles** — the dashboard project grid shows the open card count below each project description

### Fixed
- **Date format on board cards** — due dates were rendered using the UTC date from the ISO timestamp, causing an off-by-one in negative-UTC timezones; the date portion is now sliced before formatting so it matches the user's local calendar date
- **Due date picker ignored configured format** — `<input type="date">` always displays in the OS/browser locale regardless of user settings; replaced with a plain text input that parses and displays dates using the user's configured format (e.g. `DD/MM/YYYY`); a clear button appears when a date is set
- **Spellcheck in card description** — EasyMDE/CodeMirror renders text in its own span-based DOM layer so the browser's native spellchecker cannot reach it regardless of settings; the description editor is now a plain `<textarea>` (markdown is still rendered in preview/read-only mode)
- **Spellcheck in card comments** — same root cause as description; the comment editor is now a plain `<textarea>` with `spellcheck="true"` and the user's locale set as the `lang` attribute
- **Spellcheck on card title** — added `spellcheck="true"` and `lang` to the title input field
- **Session lost on browser close** — auth tokens (access + refresh) and the cached user object were stored in `localStorage`, surviving browser restarts; moved to `sessionStorage` so closing the browser or tab ends the session as expected
- **Project switching in sidebar not updating board** — Vue Router reuses the `BoardView` component when navigating between projects so `onMounted` never fires again; fixed by watching `route.params.slug` and reloading board data, project info, members, and the WebSocket connection when the slug changes; `useWebSocket` now accepts a reactive ref so the connection URL updates correctly
- **Board cards showing light background in dark mode** — `.board-card` had a hard-coded `background: #fff`; replaced with `var(--color-surface)` so it respects the active theme; priority badge colours now also have explicit `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides
- **Report date/time not following configured format** — the "Generated" timestamp and card update dates in the time report used `toLocaleString`, producing browser-locale formatting regardless of user settings; now uses the `useDateFormat` composable so the output matches the user's configured date/time format
- **Report URL printed at bottom of page** — browsers print the page URL in the margin area by default; suppressed via `@page { margin: 0 }` and explicit empty `@top-*` and `@bottom-*` margin box rules
- **PDF export missing pages** — `.app-shell-body { overflow: hidden }` clipped the print output to the visible viewport, truncating multi-page reports; overridden with `overflow: visible; height: auto` in `@media print`
- **Print header duplicated/cut off across pages** — the `position: fixed` per-page header was positioned relative to the CSS content area, overlapping content on pages 2 and onwards; replaced with native CSS `@page` margin boxes: the WarmDesk logo appears inline at the top of page 1, and "WarmDesk" text + page number (`n / total`) appear in the top margin on subsequent pages via `@page @top-left` and `@page @top-right`

## v0.2.10 — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **SMTP port saved as number** — `<input type="number">` causes Vue to send the port as a JSON number; the Go struct expected a string and rejected it with an unmarshal error; frontend now coerces to string before sending and the backend field accepts `json.Number` so either format works

## v0.2.9 — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Admin Settings tab blank** — `@` in the SMTP test email placeholder was parsed by vue-i18n as a linked-message prefix, throwing `Invalid linked format` on first render and wiping the admin panel; escaped with `{'@'}` in all five language files
- **JWT token lost on LocalStorage eviction** — access token is now also kept in the axios default header so API calls succeed even if another tab or the browser clears LocalStorage between requests
- **Admin settings errors hidden** — the `loadSettings` error handler was a silent `catch {}`; errors are now shown as toast notifications
- **SMTP password placeholder always shown** — `!!data.smtp_password_set` evaluated a non-empty string `"false"` as truthy; fixed with strict `=== 'true'` comparison
- **Reports menu hidden for admins with stale session** — cached user objects without `can_view_reports` no longer hide the Reports link for admins

## v0.2.8 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Webhook URL with live token** — after creating or regenerating a webhook, the setup docs now show the full ready-to-paste URL with the real token already substituted in; falls back to `<token>` placeholder when no token is in view

### Changed
- **Reports access restricted** — time report generation is now limited to project admins/owners and system admins; regular members and viewers no longer see the Reports menu item and are redirected if they navigate directly to `/reports`

## v0.2.7 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Git platform integration** — connect GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, or Forgejo via webhooks; push / PR / issue events post formatted messages to the project chat, and any card reference (e.g. `PRJ-42`) in a commit message or PR / issue title automatically creates a link in the card detail; links show platform badge, type (commit / pull request / issue), short reference, title, and open / closed / merged status
- **GitHub webhook** — new webhook type with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification; handles `push`, `pull_request`, `issues`, `create`, `delete`, and `ping` events
- **GitLab webhook** — new webhook type with `X-Gitlab-Token` validation; handles Push Hook, Merge Request Hook, and Issue Hook events
- **Gitea / Forgejo card links** — existing Gitea webhook now also creates card links from commit messages, PR titles, and issue titles (chat posting was already supported)
- **Documentation** — three new Markdown documents shipped with every release in `docs/`:
  - `docs/user-guide.md` — end-user walkthrough of all features
  - `docs/api.md` — Ticket API and all webhook integration reference
  - `docs/admin-guide.md` — installation, configuration, SMTP, scaling, backup, and security checklist

## v0.2.6 — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Windows build** — Tauri v2 removed `zip` as a valid `--bundles` value on Windows (only `msi` and `nsis` are supported); the CI workflow and `make windows-portable` target now build with `--bundles nsis` and create the portable zip from the compiled binary using PowerShell's `Compress-Archive`

## v0.2.5 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Emoji picker** — a full emoji picker (8 categories + search) is now available in all chat inputs (project chat, direct messages) and card editors (EasyMDE toolbar button); emojis insert at the cursor position
- **@mention autocomplete** — typing `@` in any chat input or card editor shows a dropdown of matching project members; use arrow keys to navigate, Enter/Tab to complete; mentions also work in card comments
- **Real-time mention notifications** — when a user is @mentioned and is currently online, a purple popup notification appears immediately with the sender's name, context (project chat / card comment / direct message), and a preview of the message; offline users still receive an email
- **Chats sidebar section** — the sidebar now has a collapsible "Chats" section showing the 8 most recently active conversations; each entry shows an unread indicator (pulsing red dot) when there are new messages since the conversation was last viewed
- **SMTP test email** — the admin SMTP settings page has a new "Send Test Email" field; enter any address and click Send to verify that the SMTP configuration works without leaving the admin panel

### Fixed
- **SMTP settings not saving on fresh install** — GORM `Save()` with a non-zero string primary key only issues an UPDATE, silently failing on a new database; replaced all system-setting saves with a proper upsert using `clause.OnConflict`
- **Admin error messages hidden** — the SMTP save error catch block was missing the error parameter, showing a generic fallback message instead of the real server error; now shows the actual API error message
- **Card comments missing @mention notifications** — `CreateComment` was not calling `NotifyMentions`; mentions in card comments now trigger both real-time WS notifications and emails

### Changed
- **"Direct Messages" renamed to "Chats"** — navigation item, page title, and all UI labels updated; the old `/messages` route redirects to `/chats`
- **Team Chat removed from project board** — the slide-in chat panel on the board page has been removed; project chat is accessible via dedicated project pages

## v0.2.4 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Project teams in Direct Messages** — new "Teams" tab in the new-conversation panel lists all projects the user belongs to; clicking a project pre-fills all its members and the project name as the group name, ready to start a team chat with one click
- **Project admin role** — new `admin` role between `member` and `owner`; project admins can create, rename, reorder, and delete columns; regular members cannot; board toolbar shows settings gear only to project admins and global admins
- **Group chat avatar** — group conversations can have a custom avatar image; click the group icon in the chat header to upload one
- **Auto-delete empty group chat** — when removing the last non-creator member from a group chat that has no messages, the conversation is deleted automatically and all participants are notified
- **Persistent system admin in seed** — `warmdesk-seed` now creates `tonk` (Ton Kersten) as a system admin account that is never removed by `--reset`
- **More demo users in seed** — four additional demo users (Priya Nair, James O'Brien, Elena Kovač, Raj Sharma) are created; project admin roles are demonstrated across the three demo projects

### Fixed
- **Report assignee dropdown z-index** — placeholder text was visible through the open dropdown; fixed by establishing a stacking context on the filters row

### Changed
- **Board toolbar** — project name replaces the "Project Settings" text link; the settings gear icon is only shown to users who can manage the project

## v0.2.3 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Assignee filter on time reports** — the report page now has a multi-select dropdown to filter by one, several, or all assignees; selected names are shown as a summary label; passed to the backend as a comma-separated `assignees` query param
- **Direct message history** — opening a conversation (including via a sidebar user link) now immediately loads all stored messages from the database; history persists across sessions
- **Remove member from group chat** — any group member can remove another member via the × chip next to their name in the chat header; removal is confirmed and broadcast to remaining members via WebSocket
- **Demo conversations in seed** — `warmdesk-seed` now creates 5 conversations with 42 realistic messages (4 one-on-one DMs: Alex↔Sarah, Marc↔Lisa, Sarah↔Lisa, Alex↔Marc; plus a "Website Redesign Team" group chat) with historically-spread timestamps
- **Screenshots in README** — a 2-column screenshot grid has been added to the README covering all main views

### Fixed
- **DM sidebar navigation race condition** — clicking a user in the sidebar while conversations were still loading could create a new blank conversation instead of opening the existing one; the watch handler now waits for both conversations and users to be loaded before calling `openOrCreateDM`

## v0.2.2 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Configurable initial columns** — admin can define which columns are created automatically when a new project is made (Admin → Settings → New Project Defaults); one column name per line; defaults to "Backlog"
- **Delete empty column** — a trash icon appears on any column that has no cards; clicking it asks for confirmation and removes the column

### Fixed
- **Version number on login page** — app version is now shown below the login card, matching the footer
- **Frontend version follows git tag** — `__APP_VERSION__` is now derived from `git describe --tags --always` at build time instead of the static `package.json` version; the update-available banner no longer appears falsely after a release
- **Admin sidebar shows all projects** — admins now see all projects in the sidebar, not only the ones they were explicitly added to as a member
- **PDF report shows only the report** — the browser print dialog now hides the sidebar, header, and footer so only the time report content is printed
- **Time format in reports** — changed from "1h 30m" to `H:MM` (e.g. `1:30`, `100:05`); hours are unbounded, minutes are always zero-padded to two digits

### Changed
- Default initial column renamed from "Inbox" to "Backlog"

## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Time Spent on cards** — log hours and minutes directly on a card; stored as `time_spent_minutes` and shown in the card detail dialog
- **Time Report** — new `/reports` page that generates a time overview grouped by project, filterable by period (all time / year / month / ISO week) and by project
- **Export to PDF** — print-optimised layout with company logo and period header; uses the browser's native print-to-PDF
- **Export to Excel (XLSX)** — downloads a formatted spreadsheet via SheetJS; includes ref, title, assignees, date, and time columns with subtotals per project and a grand total
- **Company branding** — admin can set a company name and logo (URL or uploaded image) under Admin → Settings → Branding; both appear on generated reports
- **Demo seed tool** — `warmdesk-seed` binary (included in the distribution) populates the database with four demo users, three projects, 32 cards with labels/assignees/checklists/comments/time, and three discussion topics; run with `--reset` to wipe and re-seed; idempotent on repeated runs
- **CLAUDE.md** — developer guide for AI-assisted development: architecture decisions, conventions, and how to add routes, models, and settings
- **Configurable idle session timeout** — admin setting (default 60 minutes); users are automatically logged out after the configured period of inactivity; set to 0 to disable
- **Update check** — on login the server is compared against the latest GitHub release; a dismissable banner is shown when a newer version is available (web and desktop)

### Fixed
- **SMTP settings could not be saved** — the save button shared a function with all auto-saving dropdowns (theme, timezone, etc.), causing SMTP fields to be sent in every general-settings request and potentially overwriting saved values; SMTP now has its own dedicated save
- **SMTP username and password made optional** — all SMTP credential fields are now pointer types in the backend; omitting them from a request leaves the stored value untouched, allowing auth-less SMTP relay configurations

### Changed
- `warmdesk-seed` is built alongside the main binary by `make build-backend` and included in distribution archives
- System settings handler splits SMTP saves from general settings saves to prevent cross-contamination

## 2026-03-28

### Added
- Tauri desktop app — distributable as AppImage (Linux), DMG (macOS), and installer (Windows)
- Topics — threaded discussions per project with markdown support and replies
- Checklists on cards
- Multiple assignees per card
- Viewer role — read-only access at project and global level
- Favourite people — mark users for quick access
- Card watchers — subscribe to card activity notifications
- Card sorting within columns by due date, assignee, or priority
- Direct message notifications
- Group direct messages
- Admin can assign users to projects directly
- Admin can reset user passwords

### Fixed
- Topics view was rendering its own header, causing duplicate search bar, language selector, and avatar
- Adding a new card showed it twice until page refresh (duplicate WebSocket event handling)
- Logo and favicon not served correctly
- Build artifacts (AppImage, DMG, Windows installer, Rust target/) excluded from git via .gitignore

### Changed
- Group DMs, markdown in chat, i18n expansion, and UI polish

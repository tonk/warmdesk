description: Perform a WarmDesk release (changelog, tag, push)
---

You are performing a WarmDesk release. The version to release is: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps in order:

## 1. Gather changes
Run `git log --oneline $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD` to see all commits since the last tag. Use these to write the release notes.

## 2. Update CHANGELOG.md
Add a new section at the top (below the `# Changelog` heading) in this format:

```
## v{version} — {today's date YYYY-MM-DD}

### Added
- ...

### Fixed
- ...

### Changed
- ...
```

Only include sections that have entries. Be specific and user-facing in the descriptions — same style as existing entries.

## 3. Update README.md
- Update the `## Latest release (v{old_version})` heading to `## Latest release (v{version})` and replace the bullet points beneath it with the highlights of this release (one to three short bullets, user-facing, same style as the existing entries).
- If any new features were added, update the **Features** list to reflect them.
- If the seed tool changed, update the **Load demo data** section.
- No other sections need changing for a routine release.

## 4. Update what.md
Append any new features or changes as bullet points at the end of the file, matching the imperative style already used there.

## 5. Update documentation
- If any changes where made, that need an update on the documentation,
  update the documentation
- If a change touches anything a multi-instance deployment depends on —
  shared config keys (`db_driver`/`db_dsn`, `redis_url`, `upload_dir`,
  `jwt_secret`, `trusted_proxies`), the WebSocket/Redis pub-sub layer, the
  auth rate limiter, or the backup scheduler — update
  `deploy/multi-instance/README.md` (and its templates) to match.

## 6. Update website version
In `website/hugo.toml`, update three values:
- Under `[params]`: `warmdesk_version = "v{version}"` and `release_date = "{today's date YYYY-MM-DD}"`
- Under `[markup.asciidocext.attributes]`: `"warmdesk-version" = "v{version}"`

The params feed the homepage release strip; the AsciiDoc attribute feeds the install docs code blocks.

## 7. Bump Ansible collection version
In `ansible/galaxy.yml`, increment the `version` field by one patch level (e.g. `0.3.1` → `0.3.2`).
Only do this if any commits since the last tag touched files under `ansible/`.

## 8. Commit and tag
```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md README.md what.md website/hugo.toml ansible/galaxy.yml
git commit -F - <<'MSG'
chore: release v{version} — CHANGELOG, README, what.md

Co-Authored-By: {model attribution}
MSG
git tag -a v{version} -m "Release v{version}"
```

End the message with a `Co-Authored-By:` line naming the model actually running this release (e.g. `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`). Don't copy a model name from an older release commit — it goes stale.

## 9. Push
```bash
for remote in origin home; do
  git push "$remote" main "v{version}"
done
```

Push to **both** `origin` (GitHub) and `home` — a plain `git push` only reaches `origin`. Push only this release's tag, not `--tags`. Don't push to the `codeberg` remote; that hosting was dropped.

Report what was pushed when done.
